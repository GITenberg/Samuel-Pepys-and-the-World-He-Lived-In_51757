<p class="drop-cap noindent"><span class="upper-case">This</span> little book does not need any
long Preface, as the title sufficiently
explains the object aimed at. Although
the various subjects referred
to in the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>” are annotated in the
different editions, there is in none of these any
complete analysis of the entire work or of the
incidents of Pepys’s life.</p>

<p>I have endeavoured in the following pages to
draw together some of the most interesting incidents
of the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>” relating both to Pepys’s
life and to the manners of his time, and also to
illustrate them from other sources. I have used
the best edition of the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>,” by the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr>
Mynors Bright; but in order that this book may
form a companion to all editions I have referred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
to the date of the entries rather than to the
volume and page. It must therefore be understood
that the passages referred to when not met
with in the other editions will be found among
the hitherto unpublished matter of that of Mr.
Bright. It has been my endeavour to illustrate
the contents of this entertaining work more completely
than has previously been attempted, and
several of the circumstances of Pepys’s life are
here brought prominently forward for the first
time. I may add that the whole of the present
volume was printed off before the appearance of
the excellent article in the July number of the
“<cite class="plain">Edinburgh Review</cite>” (1880), as otherwise it
might be supposed that certain points had been
suggested by that article. I have, however,
availed myself of its pages to make a correction
of a small matter in the Index.</p>

<p>Mr. T. C. Noble has kindly sent me, since
the completion of this book, a copy of Pepys’s
original marriage certificate from the Registers
of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Margaret’s Church, Westminster,
and I therefore insert it here to complete the
<a href="#Ref_marriage" title="Go to reference">account in Chapter <abbr title="1">I.</abbr></a> <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span><span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">“Samuell Peps of this

<p>The pronunciation of Pepys’s name has long
been a disputed point, but although the most
usual form at the present day is <i>Peps</i>, there can
be little doubt that in his own time the name was
pronounced as if written <i>Peeps</i>. The reasons
for this opinion are: (1) that the name was
sometimes so spelt phonetically by some of his
contemporaries, as in the Coffee-house paper
quoted in the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>” (<abbr title="edited by">ed.</abbr> Mynors Bright, <abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr>
<abbr title="6">vi.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 292): “On Tuesday last Mr. Peeps went
to Windsor,” <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>; (2) that this pronunciation is
still the received one at Magdalene College,
Cambridge; and (3) that the present bearers of
the name so pronounce it.</p>

<p>In conclusion, it is my pleasing duty to express
here my best thanks to those friends who have
kindly assisted me in my work. Chief among
these are Professor Newton, F.R.S., who, as
Fellow of Magdalene College, facilitated my inquiries
respecting the Pepysian Library, Mr.
Pattrick, Senior Fellow and President of the
College, Mr. Pepys Cockerell, Mr. George
Scharf, F.S.A., Mr. Richard B. Prosser, of the
Patent Office, who communicated the documents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
relating to Mrs. Pepys’s father, and Colonel
Pasley, whose List of the Secretaries of the Admiralty,
<abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, in the <a href="#Ref_Appendix_VI" title="Go to reference">Appendix</a> will be found of
great value, not merely in illustrating Pepys’s
life, but as a real addition to our information
respecting the history of the Navy.</p>

<p>P.S. Since the first publication of this book I
have received an interesting letter from Mr.
Walter Courtenay Pepys, a member of the Cottenham
branch of the Pepys family, who, while
agreeing with the statement above as to the
Diarist’s pronunciation, reminds me that his
branch have pronounced the name as “Pep-pis”
for at least one hundred years. In favour of
this pronunciation Mr. Pepys adds that the
French branch, which is now settled at La
Rochelle, but came from Languedoc and originally
from Italy (where the name exists as
“Peppi”), now spell the name <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>“Pepy.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap noindent"><span class="upper-case">Samuel Pepys</span> was the first of
a well-established stock to make
a name in the outer world, but
since his time the family can boast
of having had amongst its members
a Court physician, a bishop, and a lord
chancellor.</p>

<p>The earliest recorded Pepys was named
Thomas, and appears, on the authority of the
Court Rolls of the manor of Pelhams, in Cottenham,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
to have been bailiff of the Abbot of Crowland’s
lands in Cambridgeshire, in the early part
of the reign of Henry <abbr title="the Sixth">VI.</abbr><a name="Anchor_1" id="Anchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1.">[1]</a> From that time the
family flourished, and there seems to be some
reason for believing that certain members enriched
themselves with the spoils of the abbey
lands in the time of Henry <abbr title="the Eighth">VIII.</abbr></p>

<p>Before the Diarist became known, one of the
most distinguished members of the family was
Richard Pepys, created Lord Chief Justice of
Ireland by Charles <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr> When the King was
executed, Richard resigned his office; but he
enjoyed the favour of Cromwell, and resumed
the place. As he did not die until 1678, it is
strange that there should be no allusion to him
in the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>.”</p>

<p>The branch from which Samuel was descended
had not much money; and his father, being a
younger son, came to London and became a
tailor. This descent in the social scale has
caused much misapprehension, and his enemies
did not forget to taunt him on his connection
with tailoring; but it is a well-accredited axiom
that trade does not injure gentry. Some remarks
of Pepys himself upon his family have been
greatly misunderstood. Referring to the non-appearance
of any account of the Pepyses in
Fuller’s “Worthies,” he writes:&mdash;“But I believe,
indeed, our family were never considerable.”<a name="Anchor_2" id="Anchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2.">[2]</a>
Dr. Doran paraphrased this into: <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>“Let
others say of his family what they might: he,
for his own part, did not believe that it was of
anything like gentle descent.”<a name="Anchor_3" id="Anchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 3.">[3]</a> This is a pure
blunder, for Pepys merely meant that none of
the family had made much mark; and he would
have been very indignant had any one told him
that they were not gentle.</p>

<p>Samuel, the fifth child of John and Margaret
Pepys, was born on February 23rd, 1632, either
at Brampton, a village near Huntingdon, or in
London. There is something to be said in
favour of each supposition, but, as the registers
of Brampton church do not commence until
the year 1654,<a name="Anchor_4" id="Anchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 4.">[4]</a> the question cannot now be
definitely settled. We have Pepys’s own authority
for the statement that his father and mother
were married at Newington, in Surrey, on October
15th, 1626.<a name="Anchor_5" id="Anchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 5.">[5]</a> The register of marriages
of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mary, Newington, has been searched,
but the name of Pepys occurs neither in the
years 1625, 1626, nor in 1627,<a name="Anchor_6" id="Anchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 6.">[6]</a> and Mrs.
John Pepys’s maiden name is still unknown.
In early youth, Samuel went to a school at
Huntingdon, as appears by a passage in the
“<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>” (March 15th, 1659–60), where he writes:
“I met Tom Alcock, one that went to school
with me at Huntingdon, but I had not seen
him this sixteen years.” He seems to have
spent his youth pretty equally between town
and country, for on one occasion, when he was
walking over the fields to Kingsland, he remembered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
the time when, as a boy, he lived there,
and “used to shoot with my bow and arrow in
these fields.”<a name="Anchor_7" id="Anchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 7.">[7]</a> When he left Huntingdon he entered
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Paul’s School, and remained there until
he had reached the age of seventeen. In after
life, on the occasion of an official visit to Mercers’
Hall, he remembered the time when he was a
petitioner for his exhibition.<a name="Anchor_8" id="Anchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 8.">[8]</a> He was a stout
Roundhead in his boyish days, and this fact was
remarked upon, to his great chagrin, in after
years, by his friend and schoolfellow Mr. Christmas.
He went to see the execution of Charles <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr>
at Whitehall, and made himself conspicuous by
saying on his return that, were he to preach
upon the event of the day, he should select as
his text the verse: “The memory of the wicked
shall rot.” He was in some fear that Mr.
Christmas might remember this also, but he was
happy to find that that gentleman had left
school before the incident occurred.<a name="Anchor_9" id="Anchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 9.">[9]</a> Pepys
always took a lively interest in the welfare of his
school, to which references are frequently made
in the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>.”</p>

<p>In 1650, his name occurs as a sizar on the
boards of Trinity College, Cambridge; but
before going to reside at the University, on
March 5, 1650–51,<a name="Anchor_10" id="Anchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 10.">[10]</a> he was entered at Magdalene
College, having probably been led to make
the change by the greater inducements held out
to him by the latter college. Here he was elected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
into one of Mr. Spendluffe’s scholarships in
the following month; and two years later, on
October 14, 1653, he was preferred to one on
Dr. John Smith’s foundation. His father was
at this time described as a citizen of London.</p>

<p>Little is known of Samuel’s academic career,
during which he does not appear to have gained
much distinction; and remarks in various parts
of the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>” show that his conduct was not
such as became a Puritan. The College books
can be brought as a witness against him, for we
learn from that source that, on October 21st,
1653, “Peapys and Hind were solemnly admonished
... for having been scandalously over-served
with drink the night before.” Still, we
must not jump to the conclusion that his time
was entirely wasted, for he evidently carried
into his busy life a good stock of classical learning.
It was while he was at the University that
he made the acquaintance of the learned Selden,
from whom he borrowed the collection of ballads
which formed the basis of the famous Pepysian
collection. He relates that, while at Cambridge,
he wrote a romance entitled, “Love a Cheate,”
which he tore up on the 30th of January, 1663–64.
This work of destruction must have been performed
with some feelings of regret, for he tells
us that he rather liked the tale, and wondered
that he had ever been able to write so well.
His previous literary performances had consisted
in the concocting of some anagrams upon
Mrs. Elizabeth Whittle, afterwards the wife of
Sir Stephen Fox.<a name="Anchor_11" id="Anchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 11.">[11]</a> It is not recorded at what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
time Pepys left college, but it must have been
either in 1654 or 1655. He was made Master
of Arts by proxy, in June, 1660, the grace being
passed on the 26th of that month.</p>

<p>On the 1st of December, 1655,<a name="Anchor_12" id="Anchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 12.">[12]</a> when he was
still without any settled means of support, Pepys
married Elizabeth <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michel</span>, a beautiful and
portionless girl of fifteen. Although there is
extant a letter from Balthasar <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michel</span> to
Pepys (dated from Deal, February 8th, 1673–74),
in which the history of Mrs. Pepys’s family is
set forth, Lord Braybrooke was contented with
the information on her monument, and merely
added that she was educated in a convent,
which in point of fact she was not. The letter
alluded to was printed as far back as the year
1841,<a name="Anchor_13" id="Anchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 13.">[13]</a> and yet I cannot find that the history
contained in it has ever been used by the biographers
of Pepys. What is even more remarkable
than Lord Braybrooke’s silence respecting
it, is the fact that the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> John Smith, who
published the letter, overlooked it when he
wrote his introduction. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><abbr title="Monsieur">Mons.</abbr> <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michel</span> was
of a good family in <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Anjou</span>, but having turned
Huguenot at the age of twenty-one, when in the
German service, his father disinherited him, and
he was left penniless. He came over to England
in the retinue of Henrietta Maria, on her marriage
with Charles <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr>, as one of her Majesty’s
gentleman carvers; but the Queen dismissed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
him on finding out that he was a Protestant,
and did not go to mass. Being a handsome
man with courtly manners, he gained the affections
of the daughter of Sir Francis Kingsmall
(lately left a widow by an Irish squire), who
married him against the wishes of her family,
and, with <abbr title="1,500 pounds"><i>£</i>1,500</abbr> which they raised, the newly-married
couple started for France, in the hope
of recovering, if possible, some part of the family
estates. Unhappily, they were taken prisoners
at sea, with all their goods, by the Dunkirkers,
and when released they settled at Bideford, in
Devonshire. Here, or near by, Elizabeth and
Balthasar and the rest of the family were born.</p>

<p>In course of time they all went to France, and
the father, in command of a company of foot,
assisted at the taking of Dunkirk. He occupied
his time with propositions of perpetual motion
and other visionary schemes, and consequently
brought himself and all dependent upon him to
the brink of poverty. While he was away from
Paris, some devout Roman Catholics persuaded
Madame <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michel</span> to place her daughter in the
nunnery of the Ursulines. The father was
enraged at this action, but managed to get
Elizabeth out of the nunnery after she had been
there twelve days. Thinking that France was
a dangerous place to live in, he hurried his
family back to England, and shortly afterwards
Elizabeth married Pepys. Her father was
greatly pleased that she had become the wife
of a true Protestant; and she herself said to
him, kissing his eyes, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>“Dear father, though in
my tender years I was by my low fortune in this
world deluded to popery by the fond dictates
thereof, I have now (joined with my riper years,
which give me more understanding) a man to
my husband too wise, and one too religious in
the Protestant religion, to suffer my thoughts to
bend that way any more.”</p>

<p>There are several references in the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>”
to Mrs. Pepys’s father and mother, who seem
never to have risen out of the state of poverty
into which they had sunk. On May 2, 1662,
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><abbr title="Monsieur">Mons.</abbr> <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michel</span> took out a patent, in concert
with Sir John Collidon and Sir Edward Ford,<a name="Anchor_14" id="Anchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 14.">[14]</a>
for the purpose of curing smoky chimneys; but
this scheme could not have been very successful,
as a few months afterwards he was preparing to
go to Germany in order to fight against the
Turks.<a name="Anchor_15" id="Anchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 15.">[15]</a> Pepys gave him some work to do in
1666, and Mrs. Pepys carried the account-books
that he was to rule; but such jobs as these must
have given him but a sorry living, and in the
following year he again proposed to go abroad.
Pepys sent him three jacobuses in gold to help
him on his journey.<a name="Anchor_16" id="Anchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 16.">[16]</a> We hear nothing more of
either father or mother, with the exception of an
allusion to their pleasure at seeing the prosperous
state of their daughter<a name="Anchor_17" id="Anchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 17.">[17]</a>&mdash;a prosperity in which
they certainly did not share.</p>

<p>This account of Mrs. Pepys’s parentage has
led us away from the early days of Pepys, when,
with improvident passion, <a name="Ref_marriage" id="Ref_marriage" class="noline">he married</a> his young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
wife; and we will therefore return to the year
1655. Early marriages were then far from uncommon,
and Mrs. Pepys’s beauty was considered
as forming a very valid excuse for the improvidence
of the match. There seems to be some
reason for believing that she was of a dark complexion,
for her husband on one occasion was
mad with her for dressing herself according to the
fashion in fair hair.<a name="Anchor_18" id="Anchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 18.">[18]</a> Sir Edward Montagu, who
was Pepys’s first cousin one remove (Samuel’s
grandfather and Sir Edward’s mother being
brother and sister), gave a helping hand to the
imprudent couple, and allowed them to live in
his house. The Diarist alludes to this time,
when, some years afterwards, he writes of how
his wife “used to make coal fires, and wash” his
“foul clothes with her own hand,” in their little
room at Lord Sandwich’s.<a name="Anchor_19" id="Anchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 19.">[19]</a></p>

<p>Samuel does not appear to have lived with
his father after he had grown up, and as old
John Pepys was not a very thriving tradesman,
it seems likely that Montagu had previously
assisted his young kinsman. Indeed, it was probably
under his patronage that Samuel went to
the University.</p>

<p>The Diarist seems to have held some official
position in the year 1656, because on Thursday,
August 7th, a pass was granted “to John Pepys
and his man with necessaries for Holland, being
on the desire of Mr. <abbr title="Samuel">Sam<span class="super">ll</span>.</abbr> Pepys.”<a name="Anchor_20" id="Anchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 20.">[20]</a> John Pepys
had probably long been in the habit of going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
backwards and forwards to Holland, for Samuel
writes (January 24th, 1665–66): “We went through
Horslydowne, where I never was since a little
boy, that I went to enquire after my father,
whom we did give over for lost coming from
Holland.” Whether these journeys were undertaken
in the way of business, or whether they
had any connection with Montagu’s affairs, we
cannot now tell. That Samuel acted as a sort
of agent for Montagu, we have evidence; and
among the Rawlinson Manuscripts in the Bodleian
Library is a memorandum of the payment
to him on General Montagu’s part for the ransom
of the Marquis of Baydez (22nd January, 1656–57).</p>

<p>On March 26th, 1658, he underwent an operation
for the stone, a disease that seems to have
been inherited. The operation was successfully
performed, and ever after he made a practice of
celebrating the anniversary of this important
event in his life with thanksgiving.</p>

<p>In 1659 he accompanied Sir Edward Montagu
in the “Naseby,” when that admiral made his expedition
to the Sound; and he was very surprised
to learn afterwards how negotiations had been
carried on of which at the time he was quite
ignorant. This is not the place for a history of
the various stages that led to the Restoration,
but a passing allusion to one of these may be
allowed here, as the particulars are given in the
“<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>.” When Sir Edward Montagu left
England for the Sound, he said to the Protector
Richard, on parting with him, that <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>“he should
rejoice more to see him in his grave at his return
home, than that he should give way to such
things as were then in hatching, and afterwards
did ruin him.”<a name="Anchor_21" id="Anchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 21.">[21]</a> Finding the condition of affairs
in England hopeless, Montagu took advantage of
this expedition to correspond with Charles <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr>;
but he had to be careful and secret, for his fellow-plenipotentiary,
Algernon Sidney, who suspected
him, was an enemy.<a name="Anchor_22" id="Anchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 22.">[22]</a> Pepys’s remark on finding
out what had been going on under his nose
was, “I do from this raise an opinion of him, to
be one of the most secret men in the world,
which I was not so convinced of before.”<a name="Anchor_23" id="Anchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 23.">[23]</a></p>

<p>On Pepys’s return to England he was employed
in the office of Mr., afterwards Sir George,
Downing, as a clerk of the Exchequer connected
with the pay of the army, and soon afterwards
commenced to keep the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>” which we now
possess.</p>

<p>The account of the incidents of Pepys’s early
life must be more or less fragmentary, as they
can be obtained merely from occasional allusions;
and it is only in the <a href="#Ref_Chapter_II" title="Go to reference">next chapter</a>, in which
we see Pepys in the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>,” that we can
obtain any full idea of the man as painted by
himself. Before passing on to this part of our
subject, it will be well to set down a few notes
on the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>” as a book. The book has
thrown such a flood of light upon the history
and manners of the middle of the seventeenth
century, that we are apt to forget the fact that
before the year 1825 the world knew nothing of
this man of gossip. Yet so ungrateful are we
to our benefactors, that the publication of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
“<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>” did an immense injury to the writer’s
reputation. Previously he was known as a staid,
trustworthy, and conscientious man of business;
as a patron of science and literature, and as a
President of the Royal Society. Jeremy Collier
says, he was “a philosopher of the severest
morality.” Since 1825 we have been too apt
to forget the excellence of his official life, and to
think of him only as a busybody and a <i>quidnunc</i>.</p>

<p>When Pepys’s library was presented to Magdalene
College, Cambridge, by his nephew, John
Jackson, in 1724, there were, among the other
treasures, six small volumes of closely-written
<abbr title="manuscript">MS.</abbr> in shorthand (upwards of three thousand
pages in all), which attracted little or no notice
until after the publication of Evelyn’s “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>.”
Then it was that the <abbr title="Honourable">Hon.</abbr> and <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> George
Neville, Master of the College, drew them out
of their obscurity, and submitted them to his
kinsman, the well-known statesman, Lord Grenville,
who had as a law student practised shorthand.
Lord Grenville deciphered a few of the
pages, and drew up an alphabet and list of arbitrary
signs. These were handed to John Smith,
an undergraduate of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John’s College, who
undertook to decipher the whole. He commenced
his labours in the spring of 1819, and
completed them in April, 1822&mdash;having thus
worked for nearly three years, usually for twelve
and fourteen hours a day.<a name="Anchor_24" id="Anchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 24.">[24]</a> What was remarkable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
in all this was, that in the Pepysian library
there rested a little volume which contained the
account of Charles <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr>’s escape after the battle
of Worcester, taken down in shorthand by Pepys
from the King’s dictation, and written out by
himself in long-hand. Here, therefore, was the
key that would have unlocked the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>” quite
overlooked. Lord Braybrooke made the statement
that the cipher used by Pepys “greatly resembled
that known by the name of Rich’s system;”
but this was misleading, as the system
really adopted was the earlier one of Thomas
Shelton. Mr. J. E. Bailey, F.S.A., communicated
a very valuable paper, “<cite class="plain">On the Cipher of
Pepys’s Diary</cite>,” to the Manchester Literary
Club in 1876, in which he gave particulars of the
various old systems of shorthand, and expressed
the opinion that Pepys made himself familiar
with Shelton’s “<cite class="plain">Tachygraphy</cite>”<a name="Anchor_25" id="Anchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 25.">[25]</a> while a student
at Cambridge. The earliest edition of Rich’s
“<cite class="plain">Pen’s Dexterity</cite>” was published in 1654, while in
1642 Shelton could refer to twenty years’ experience
as a shorthand-writer. When the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr>
Mynors Bright was about to decipher the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>“<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>”
afresh, he consulted Shelton’s book, a copy of
which, with other works on shorthand, is preserved
in the Pepysian Library. Mr. Bright informs
us that, “When Pepys wished to keep anything
<em>particularly concealed</em>, he wrote his cipher
generally in French, sometimes in Latin, or
Greek, or Spanish. This gave me a great deal
of trouble. Afterwards he changed his plan and
put in <em>dummy</em> letters. I was quite puzzled at
this, and was nearly giving up in despair the
hope of finding out his device, but at last, by
rejecting every other letter, I made out the
words. It would have been better for Pepys’s
credit if these passages could not have been deciphered,
as all of them are quite unfit for publication.”</p>

<p>Pepys was a great lover of shorthand, and he
was always ready to invent a character, as it was
then called, for a friend. He used the art in
drafting his public and private letters; and although
he was forced to discontinue his “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>”
in 1669, on account of the weakness of his eyesight,
he continued its use throughout his life.</p>

<p>We learn from the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>” itself some particulars
of how it was written. The incidents of
each day were dotted down in short, and then
the writer shut himself up in his office to fill up
all the details. Sometimes he was in arrear:
thus we read, on January 1st, 1662–63, “So to
my office to set down these two or three days’
journal;” on September 24th, 1665, “Then I in
the cabin to writing down my journal for these
last seven days to my great content;” and on
November 10th, 1665, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>“Up and entered all my
journal since the 28th of October, having every
day’s passage well in my head, though it troubles
me to remember it.”</p>

<p>Lord Braybrooke, who first introduced the
“<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>” to the public, had no very accurate
notions of the duties of an editor; and he treated
his manuscript in a very unsatisfactory manner.
Large portions were omitted without explanation,
and apparently without reason; and although
much was added to succeeding editions, still the
reader might well say&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="p_line_i0">“That cruel something unpossess’d</div>
    <div class="p_line_i0">Corrodes and leavens all the rest.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The third edition, published in 1848, contained
a large mass of restored passages, amounting, it
is said, to not less than one-fourth of the entire
work. Some fresh notes were added to the
fourth edition, published in 1854; but no alteration
of the text was made beyond “the correction
of a few verbal errors and corrupt passages
hitherto overlooked.” Subsequent editions have
been mere reprints of these. In 1875 appeared
the first volume of the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Mynors Bright’s
entirely new edition, with about one-third of
matter never yet published, all of which was of
the true Pepysian flavour. Here was a treat for
the lovers of the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>” which they little expected.</p>

<p>Having traced the particulars of Pepys’s life
to the year 1659, and described the way in which
the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>” was written, and the means by
which it first saw the light, I will now pass on
to notice, in the <a href="#Ref_Chapter_II" title="Go to reference">next chapter</a>, the chief personal
incidents recorded in the book itself.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap noindent"><span class="upper-case">On</span> the 1st of January, 1659–60,
Samuel Pepys (then in his twenty-seventh
year) commenced to write
his famous “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>.” If, as seems
more than probable, he had previously
kept a journal of some kind, all traces of
it are now lost; and our earliest glimpses of the
circumstances of his life are to be obtained only
from the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>,” which is by far the most remarkable
book of its kind in existence. Other
men have written diaries and confessions, but
they have been intended either for the public or
at least for a small circle of friends to see. This
“<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>” was only intended for the writer’s eye.
He wrote it in secret, and when he unguardedly
told Sir William Coventry in the Tower that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
kept a diary, he was sorry for his indiscretion immediately
afterwards. Pepys has been likened to
the barber of King Midas, who relieved his mind
by communicating to a bundle of reeds the fact
that his master had the ears of an ass; and
assuredly no other writer has so unreservedly
stripped his soul bare. It is, therefore, only fair
to bear in mind what is said in the motto at the
head of this chapter, and not to forget that very
few could bear the accusing witness of such a truthful
record of thoughts as well as actions as is here.
The “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>” extends over nearly ten eventful
years in the history of England, and contains
a voluminous record of both public and private
events. The fascination of Pepys’s garrulity
is so great, that most of those who have written
about him have found it difficult to restrain their
praise within bounds. A writer in the “<cite class="plain">Athenæum</cite>”
(apparently the late Peter Cunningham)
was quite carried away by his subject when he
wrote&mdash;“He has the minuteness of Dee and Ashmole
without their tediousness, the playfulness of
Swift in his best moments without his prejudice
and his party feelings, and a charm over Byron
and Scott, and, indeed, above all other memorialists
that we can call to mind, in that his
Diary was kept without the slightest view to
publication.”<a name="Anchor_26" id="Anchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 26.">[26]</a></p>

<p>I will now first note some of the chief circumstances
of Pepys’s life during the period
covered by the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>,” and then say something
about his character as it is painted by himself.</p>

<p>When we are first introduced to Pepys he is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
living in Axe Yard, Westminster, with very
small means of support, but making so good
a show that he is esteemed rich. His family
consists of himself, his wife, and servant Jane.
During the frosty weather they have not a coal in
the house, and he is forced to dine at his father’s,
or make himself as comfortable as he can up in
the garret. That the larder is not very plentifully
supplied is seen by the fact that, on the 1st
of February, he and his wife dine on pease pudding,
and on nothing else. At one time he has
not money enough in the house to pay the rent,
but soon afterwards he finds himself worth <abbr title="40 pounds"><i>£</i>40</abbr>
which he did not expect, and is therefore afraid
that he must have forgotten something. On the
16th of January, Mr. Downing (in whose office
he then was) asked our Diarist, in a half-hearted
way, whether he would go to Holland, and gave
him the impression that his services could be
dispensed with. At this time political affairs
were in the greatest confusion, and no one knew
what opinions to hold with profit to himself.
Thus, William Symons said that “he had made
shift to keep in, in good esteem and employment
through eight governments in one year, and
then failed unhappy in the ninth, <abbr title="videlicet">viz.</abbr>, that of
the King’s coming in.”<a name="Anchor_27" id="Anchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 27.">[27]</a></p>

<p>As in times of anarchy every one wishes to
talk, the Rota, or Coffee Club founded by James
Harrington, the author of “<cite class="plain">Oceana</cite>,” was found
to be a congenial resort by those who wished to
express their opinions on passing events. The
principle of the club was political, and the plan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
formed there for the government of the country
was, that every official should be chosen by
ballot. Every year a third part of the House of
Commons were to “rote out by ballot,” and no
magistrate was to continue in his position more
than three years. Other than politicians attended
the meetings, and many distinguished men, such
as Dr. Petty, Dr. Croon, Sir William Poultney,
and Cyriack Skinner, were to be found in the
evening at the Turk’s Head, in the New Palace
Yard. The room was usually as full as it would
hold, and Aubrey gives it as his opinion that the
arguments heard in Parliament were flat as
compared with those delivered at the Rota Club.
The object of worship was the ballot-box, and
the company sat round an oval table, which had
a passage in the middle for Miles, the landlord,
to deliver his coffee. Pepys paid his eighteen-pence
on becoming a member of the club, on
the 9th of January, 1659–60, and he frequently
attended after this. If the following can be considered
as a good illustration of proceedings,
there must have been considerable divergence
in the opinions of the members:&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>“I went to the
Coffee Club and heard very good discourse; it
was in answer to Mr. Harrington’s answer, who
said that the state of the Roman government
was not a settled government, and so it was no
wonder that the balance of property was in one
hand, and the command in another, it being
therefore always in a posture of war; but it was
carried by ballot, that it was a steady government;
so to-morrow it is to be proved by the
opponents that the balance lay in one hand
and the government in another.”<a name="Anchor_28" id="Anchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 28.">[28]</a> On the 20th of
February, Pepys writes: “After a small debate
upon the question whether learned or unlearned
subjects are best, the club broke up very poorly,
and I do not think they will meet any more.”
After the Restoration Harrington was put in the
Tower, and then removed to Portsea Castle.
His imprisonment turned him mad, so that he
fancied his perspiration turned sometimes to flies
and sometimes to bees, but all his hallucinations
were inoffensive. One of the first steps taken
by Monk towards obtaining a free Parliament
was the admission of the secluded members
who had been previously purged out. Pepys
describes the marching-in of these men on the
21st of February, and specially notices Prynne’s
“old basket-hilt sword.” The editors of the
“<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>” might have illustrated this by an
amusing passage from Aubrey’s “<cite class="plain">Lives</cite>.” It
appears that as the members were going to the
House, Prynne’s long rusty sword “ran between
Sir William Waller’s short legs, and threw him
down;” which caused laughter, as Aubrey takes
care to add. About this time Pepys seems to
have discerned the signs of the times, for we find
him, on a visit to Audley End, drinking the
health of the King down in a cellar.<a name="Anchor_29" id="Anchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 29.">[29]</a> Sir Edward
Montagu now comes to the front, and is intent
upon benefiting his kinsman. Pepys hopes to
be made Clerk of the Peace for Westminster,
but finds the place already promised to another.
Montagu offers him the post of Secretary to
the Generals at Sea, which he joyfully accepts;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
and he receives his warrant on the 22nd of
March. The following day sees the party on
board the “Swiftsure” at Longreach, where Pepys
receives a letter directed to “S. P., <abbr title="Esqire">Esq.</abbr>,” and
this superscription seems to have delighted him
greatly, for he says, “of which God knows I was
not a little proud.” On the 30th inst. Montagu
and his people went on board the “Naseby,” which
was the ship in which he had gone to the Sound
in the previous year. They remain for a time in
the neighbourhood of Deal, and on the 3rd of
May the King’s declaration and letter to the two
generals is received by Montagu, who dictates to
Pepys the words in which he wishes the vote in
favour of the King to be couched. The captains
all came on board the “Naseby,” and Pepys read
the letter and declaration to them; and while
they were discoursing on the subject he pretended
to be drawing up the form of vote, which Montagu
had already settled. When the resolution
was read, it passed at once; and the seamen all
cried out, “God bless King Charles!” a cry that
was echoed by the whole fleet. A little piece of
Pepys’s vanity (and perhaps shrewdness also)
here peeps out, for he tells us that he signed all
the copies of the vote of the Council of War, so
that if it should by chance get into print his
name might be attached to it.<a name="Anchor_30" id="Anchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 30.">[30]</a> The English
fleet lies off the Dutch coast about the middle of
May, and our Diarist avails himself of the opportunity
to visit the Hague and some of the chief
towns of Holland. The Dukes of York and
Gloucester came on board the “Naseby” on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
22nd inst., and the King followed them on the
following day, when the opportunity of his visit
was taken to change the objectionable names of
the ships. The “Naseby” became the “Charles,”
the “Richard” the “James,” the “Speaker” the
“Mary,” and the “Lambert” the “Henrietta.”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="p_line_i0">“The Naseby now no longer England’s shame,</div>
    <div class="p_line_i0">But better to be lost in Charles his name.”<a name="Anchor_31" id="Anchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 31.">[31]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Pepys takes the opportunity, when the Duke of
York is on board, to bespeak his favour; and is
overjoyed at the Duke calling him Pepys. On
the 25th the King lands at Dover, and is received
by Monk. Pepys tells how the mayor
presented the King with a handsome Bible,
which he received, and told the people that “it
was the thing he loved above all things in the
world!”</p>

<p>The 5th of June was Pepys’s last day on
board, and he was awoke about three o’clock in
the morning by the pouring into his mouth of
the water with which the people above were
washing the deck; and he was forced to rise
and sleep leaning on the table. He returned to
shore better off than he had originally left it, as
he took care to make use of his opportunities by
getting men made captains, and by obtaining
gratuities for the favours. Fortune continued
to smile upon him, for he had not been many
days back in London when Sir Edward Montagu,
now a Knight of the Garter, and in high
favour with the King, obtained for him the promise
of the place of Clerk of the Acts. On the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
28th of June he clears himself of his old office
under Sir George Downing, and is glad to part
from this stingy fellow, as he calls him. On the
following day he gets his warrant, but is much
cast down when he learns that his predecessor,
Mr. Barlow, is still alive, and coming up to town
to look after the place. General Monk’s wife
wishes the clerkship to be given to Mr. Turner,
of the Navy Office; but Montagu’s influence
secures it for Pepys. Turner then offers to give
Pepys <abbr title="150 pounds"><i>£</i>150</abbr> to be joined with him in the patent,
but this is refused. Pepys is kept in a great
state of excitement respecting Barlow for a
time. He hears that he is a sickly man, and on
July 17th he agrees to give him <abbr title="100 pounds"><i>£</i>100</abbr> a year
out of his raised salary. This payment continued
until February, 1664–65, when Barlow died.
Pepys’s remarks on the death are particularly
characteristic: “For which God knows my heart,
I could be as sorry as is possible for one to be
for a stranger, by whose death he gets <abbr title="100 pounds"><i>£</i>100</abbr> per
annum, he being a worthy honest man; but
when I come to consider the providence of God
by this means unexpectedly to give me <abbr title="100 pounds"><i>£</i>100</abbr> a
year more in my estate, I have cause to bless
God, and do it from the bottom of my heart.”<a name="Anchor_32" id="Anchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 32.">[32]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>
<p>Now, our Diarist has become a man of importance,
as one of the principal Officers of the
Navy, and Montagu consequently asks him to
dinner for the first time.<a name="Anchor_33" id="Anchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 33.">[33]</a> Yet he has not
much faith in his power to keep the place;
and when a Mr. Man offers him <abbr title="1,000 pounds"><i>£</i>1,000</abbr> for it,
his mouth waters, and he would gladly take the
money if his patron would agree.<a name="Anchor_34" id="Anchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 34.">[34]</a> On the 23rd
of July he takes the oaths as a Clerk of the Privy
Seal, which he does not expect to be a very profitable
office; but he soon finds himself making
about <abbr title="3 pounds"><i>£</i>3</abbr> a day,<a name="Anchor_35" id="Anchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 35.">[35]</a> in addition to his regular salary
at the Navy Office. Being settled at his house
in Seething Lane, attached to the office, he is
glad to get his little house in Axe Yard off his
hands, which he does on the 17th of September,
receiving <abbr title="41 pounds"><i>£</i>41</abbr> for his interest in it. About this
time he is sworn as a justice of the peace,
and he is “mightily pleased” at the honour,
although he confesses that he is wholly ignorant
of the duties.<a name="Anchor_36" id="Anchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 36.">[36]</a></p>

<p>There were great doings at the coronation
of Charles <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> in the following year, and the
“<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>” is full of particulars respecting it. Pepys
and a party went to a shop in Cornhill to see
the procession when the King passed from the
Tower to Whitehall, and while they waited they
partook of “wine and good cake.”<a name="Anchor_37" id="Anchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 37.">[37]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>
<p>On the next day Pepys gets into Westminster
Abbey to see the coronation, and sits patiently
in a scaffold from a little after four until eleven.
Afterwards he goes into Westminster Hall, sees
the banquet, and returns home to bed with the
feeling that he will “never see the like again in
this world.” Next morning he wakes with his “head
in a sad taking through the last night’s drink.”<a name="Anchor_38" id="Anchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 38.">[38]</a></p>

<p>Sometimes the Clerk of the Acts has a great
deal of business to get through, and he always
sticks to his work manfully. By going to the
office early and staying late he was often able to
spare the afternoons for the theatre. Day after
day he gets up and is at his desk at four o’clock
in the morning;<a name="Anchor_39" id="Anchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 39.">[39]</a> but this hard work is varied by
some idle days. On June the 5th the Officers of
the Navy play at bowls and drink and talk.
Pepys takes his flageolet, and plays upon the
leads. Sir William Penn comes out in his shirt-sleeves,
and there is more drinking and talking,
the result of which is, that Pepys goes to bed
nearly fuddled, and wakes up the next morning
with an aching head.</p>

<p>A very important event in the life of the
Diarist occurred in the following month. His
uncle, Robert Pepys, dies, and a small property
at Brampton, worth about <abbr title="80 pounds"><i>£</i>80</abbr> per annum,<a name="Anchor_40" id="Anchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 40.">[40]</a>
comes into the possession of old John Pepys,
not, however, without some litigation on the
part of some members of the family. As his
father has no money, Samuel takes all the business
affairs into his own hands, and seems to
consider the property as his own. When he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
learns the news, on the 6th of July, 1661, he
posts down to Brampton, leaving London between
eleven and twelve o’clock in the morning,
and arriving there about nine o’clock at night.
When he gets to his uncle’s house he is very
uncomfortable, from the badness of the food and
drink, and the biting of the gnats; but although
he is nearly out of his wits, he appears contented,
so as not to trouble his father. He has much
work of arrangement to get through, and he remains
nearly sixteen days away from London.
When he returns he gives out among his most
distinguished friends and acquaintances that he
has had an estate of <abbr title="200 pounds"><i>£</i>200</abbr> a year in land left
him, beside money, “because he would put an
esteem upon himself.”<a name="Anchor_41" id="Anchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 41.">[41]</a></p>

<p>Pepys acknowledged to two weaknesses, of
which he tried to cure himself by means of
vows&mdash;not, however, with a very successful result.
The first weakness was a too great addiction
to the bottle, and the second a too frequent
attendance at theatres. On July 26th, 1661, we
find him making this confession: “Having the
beginning of this week made a vow to myself to
drink no wine this week (finding it unfit me to
look after business), and this day breaking of it
against my will, I am much troubled for it; but
I hope God will forgive me!” On Michaelmas
Day, 1661, he took so much wine that he “was
even almost foxed,” so that he “durst not read
prayers for fear of being perceived by my servants
in what case I was.” Next year, on the
same day, he finds that his <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>“oaths for drinking
of wine and going to plays are out,” and so he
resolves to take some liberty, “and then fall to
them again.” On December 30th, 1662, we find
him writing: “After dinner drinking five or six
glasses of wine, which liberty I now take till I
begin my oathe again.”<a name="Anchor_42" id="Anchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 42.">[42]</a></p>

<p>On October 29th, 1663, he drinks some hippocras,
which consists of wine mixed with sugar
and spices, under the belief that he is not breaking
his vow, because it is “only a mixed compound
drink, and not any wine.” Sir Walter
Scott likened this piece of casuistry to that of
Fielding’s Newgate chaplain, who preferred
punch to wine because the former was a liquor
nowhere spoken against in Scripture.</p>

<p>It is necessary now to return to the date at
which we broke off to follow our hero’s vows.
He sums up his blessings on February 23rd,
1661–62, in these words: “I am 29 years of
age, and in very good health, and like to live
and get an estate; and if I have a heart to be
contented, I think I may reckon myself as happy
a man as any is in the world, for which God be
praised.” Yet, on the next day, he is troubled
to part with <abbr title="5 pounds"><i>£</i>5</abbr> for five weeks’ music-lessons;
and soon afterwards he complains at his father
spending <abbr title="100 pounds"><i>£</i>100</abbr> a year.<a name="Anchor_43" id="Anchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 43.">[43]</a> Although he was of a
saving turn, he could clearly see that it was
wise to spend money while he could enjoy the
results of his spending, and alludes to this on two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
separate occasions. On May 20th, 1662, he
writes: “But though I am much against too
much spending, yet I do think it best to enjoy
some degree of pleasure now that we have
health, money, and opportunity, rather than to
leave pleasures to old age or poverty when we
cannot have them so properly.” Four years after
this we find the same idea in other words: “The
truth is I do indulge myself a little the more in
pleasure, knowing that this is the proper age of
my life to do it; and out of my observation that
most men that do thrive in the world do forget
to take pleasure during the time that they are
getting their estate, but reserve that till they
have got one, and then it is too late for them to
enjoy it with any pleasure.”<a name="Anchor_44" id="Anchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 44.">[44]</a></p>

<p>About this time Pepys is sworn a younger
brother of the Trinity House, is made a burgess
of Portsmouth, is troubled with a lawsuit by one
Field, signs warrants as a justice of the peace,
and is appointed one of the Commissioners for
the Affairs of Tangier. This business with Field,
which was connected with the office, gives him
much annoyance. At one time he is in fear of
being taken by the bailiffs,<a name="Anchor_45" id="Anchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 45.">[45]</a> and at another he is
in such terror that the falling of something behind
a door makes him start with fright.<a name="Anchor_46" id="Anchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 46.">[46]</a></p>

<p>About the middle of the year 1662 he engages
the services of Mr. Cooper, mate of the “Royal
George,” of whom he intends to learn mathematics;
but his early attempts do not appear
to have been very ambitious, for he begins by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
learning the multiplication-table. In the following
year, he and Mrs. Pepys learn to dance, and
he thinks he shall be able to manage the coranto
well enough. He grudges the cost, however,
particularly as he is forced by his oath to give
half as much more to the poor.<a name="Anchor_47" id="Anchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 47.">[47]</a></p>

<p>The mixture of extravagance and frugality
that is constantly exhibited in the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>” is
most amusing, particularly in the case of clothes.
Thus, when he hears that the Queen is ill, he
stops the making of his velvet cloak until he sees
whether she lives or dies.<a name="Anchor_48" id="Anchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 48.">[48]</a> In spite of this forethought,
he finds, on casting up his accounts,
that he spent <abbr title="55 pounds"><i>£</i>55</abbr> on his own clothes, although,
as a set-off against this large sum, Mrs. Pepys’s
clothes only cost <abbr title="12 pounds"><i>£</i>12</abbr>. This love of fine clothes
is continually peeping out, and it has been suggested
that he inherited it with the tailor blood
of his father. A better reason, however, may be
found in the fact that at one time he was very
poor, and “forced to sneak like a beggar” for
want of clothes; so that, now he is in funds, he
tries to make up for his former deficiency, and
resolves to dress himself handsomely.<a name="Anchor_49" id="Anchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 49.">[49]</a></p>

<p>A few years after this he expresses himself as
ashamed of the shabbiness of his clothes, when
he wished to speak to the King but did not like
to do so, because his linen was dirty and his
clothes mean.<a name="Anchor_50" id="Anchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 50.">[50]</a></p>

<p>At the end of the year 1663, Pepys performed
a duty in a way that did him great credit. Sir
Edward Montagu, now Earl of Sandwich, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
taken ill, and, on his recovery, he goes for
change of air to Chelsea. After a time it gets
abroad that he dotes upon one of the daughters
of his landlady, and neglects his duties. On the
9th of September, 1663, Mr. Pickering tells
Pepys of all this, and we therefore read in the
“<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>:” “I am ashamed to see my lord so
grossly play the fool, to the flinging-off of all
honour, friends, servants, and everything and
person that is good, with his carrying her abroad
and playing on his lute under her window, and
forty other poor sordid things, which I am grieved
to hear.” Pepys determines to be silent, as he
learns that the Earl will not bear any allusion to
his doings. Still his mind continually reverts to
the matter, and in the end he decides to write a
letter of counsel to his patron.<a name="Anchor_51" id="Anchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 51.">[51]</a> When this is
sent, he continues for some time to be anxious
as to the manner in which the Earl is likely to
receive it. Nothing is, of course, said when the
two meet, and there is for a time a coldness
between them; but at last they return to their
old relations with each other, and Lord Sandwich,
having left Chelsea, is seen in the world
again.</p>

<p>Pepys’s habit of sitting up late, reading and
writing by candlelight, begins to tell upon his
eyesight; and in January, 1663–64, he finds it
fail him for the first time. In October, 1664, he
consults the celebrated Mr. Cocker as to the
best glass to save his eyes at night; but they
continue to trouble him, and he proposes to get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
some green spectacles.<a name="Anchor_52" id="Anchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 52.">[52]</a> How the eyesight got
weaker, so that the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>” had to be discontinued,
we all know to our great loss.</p>

<p>On one occasion Mr. Coventry talks with
Pepys on the need for a history of the navy of
England, and then suggests that he should
write a history of the late Dutch war. Pepys likes
the idea, as he thinks it agrees with his genius,
and would recommend him much to the authorities;<a name="Anchor_53" id="Anchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 53.">[53]</a>
but he succeeded in doing this without
writing the history. On the 10th of March,
1663–64, he was appointed one of the assistants
of the Corporation of the Royal Fishery, of
which the Duke of York was the Governor; his
commission as Treasurer of the Tangier Committee
is signed on the 18th of April, 1665; and
in October of the same year he obtains the appointment
of Surveyor-General of the Victualling
Office. Besides these tangible proofs of his
success in life were the expressions of esteem
made use of in respect to him by men in authority.
The Duke of York told him that he highly
valued his services,<a name="Anchor_54" id="Anchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 54.">[54]</a> and the Duke of Albemarle
said that he was the right hand of the navy.<a name="Anchor_55" id="Anchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 55.">[55]</a></p>

<p>Pepys quite deserved these words of praise,
and moreover continued to deserve them, for
during the whole period of the Dutch war he did
his best to provide what was required for the
navy, and while the plague was devastating
London he alone remained at his post. His
straightforward common-sense shows out strongly
during the course of the Great Fire. From the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
2nd of September, 1666&mdash;when the servants
wake him to tell of the burning which they saw
in the city&mdash;to the 7th, when he visits the ruins,
we have a lively picture of the whole scene in
the pages of the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>.” On the Sunday Pepys
goes to Whitehall, and tells the King and the
Duke of York of what he had seen. He says
that unless his Majesty will command houses to
be pulled down, nothing can stop the fire. On
hearing which, the King instructs him to go to
the Lord Mayor, and command him to pull down
houses in every direction. Sir Thomas Bludworth,
the Lord Mayor, seems to have been but
a poor creature; and when he heard the King’s
message, “he cried like a fainting woman, ‘Lord!
what can I do? I am spent: people will not
obey me. I have been pulling down houses, but
the fire overtakes us faster than we can do it.’”
On the 4th inst. there seemed to be little hope
of saving the Navy Office, unless some extraordinary
means were taken with that object.
Pepys therefore suggested that the workmen
from Woolwich and Deptford Dockyards should
be sent for to pull down the houses round them.
Sir William Penn went to see after the men, and
Pepys wrote to Sir William Coventry for the
Duke of York’s permission. In the letter he
remarks that the fire is very near them, both on
the Tower Street and Fenchurch sides; and that
unless houses are pulled down, there are little
hopes of their escape. The next day Penn
sends up the men, who help greatly in the
blowing-up of houses; and to this action Pepys
mainly attributes the stoppage of the fire. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
then goes up to the top of Barking church,
and there he saw “the saddest sight of desolation”&mdash;“everywhere
great fires, oil-cellars,
and brimstone and other things burning.” He
then walks through the town, the hot ground
almost burning his feet, till he comes to Moorfields,
which he finds full of people, “the poor
wretches carrying their goods there, and everybody
keeping his goods together by themselves.”</p>

<p>During the period of fright, when he expected
the office to be destroyed, he sent off his money,
plate, and best things to Sir W. Rider, at Bethnal
Green, and then he and Penn dug a hole in the
garden, in which they put their wine and Parmezan
cheese. On the 10th of September, Sir
W. Rider lets it be known that, as the town is
full of the report respecting the wealth in his
house, he will be glad if his friends will provide
for the safety of their property elsewhere.</p>

<p>About the time of the Great Fire, Pepys had
saved a large sum of money, and was making a
good income; so we find his thoughts running on
the advantage of keeping a private coach, as he
is ashamed to be seen in a hackney coach.<a name="Anchor_56" id="Anchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 56.">[56]</a> It
was not, however, until more than a year after this
that he actually bought his carriage, and we find
that he spent <abbr title="53 pounds"><i>£</i>53</abbr> on the coach,<a name="Anchor_57" id="Anchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 57.">[57]</a> and <abbr title="50 pounds"><i>£</i>50</abbr>
on a fine pair of black horses.<a name="Anchor_58" id="Anchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 58.">[58]</a> He was very
proud of the appearance of his carriage, but his
enemies made some capital out of the proceeding,
and protested that he throve on the distresses
of others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>In these days of banks and other means for the
deposit of money, it is not easy to realize the
difficulties of men who possessed money in the
seventeenth century. Pepys sent some down to
Brampton to be buried, but his wife and father
did the business entrusted to them so badly that
he was quite wild and uneasy with fears that it
might be found by others.<a name="Anchor_59" id="Anchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 59.">[59]</a> Therefore, at the
first opportunity, he goes down himself to see
after his treasure; and the description of the hunt
after it is certainly one of the most entertaining
passages in the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>.”<a name="Anchor_60" id="Anchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 60.">[60]</a> He and his father
and wife go out into the garden with a dark
lantern, and grope about a long time before they
come on the trace. Then they find that the
bags are rotten, and gold and notes are all
spread about and covered with dirt, the latter
being scarcely distinguishable. Then there is a
gathering of it up to be washed, and in the end
not much is lost, although throughout the proceedings
Pepys is in dread that the neighbours
will see and hear what is going on.</p>

<p>We now come to the consideration of one
of the most important incidents in the life of
the Diarist&mdash;that is, his great speech at the
Bar of the House of Commons. When peace
was concluded with the Dutch, and the people
had time to think over the disgrace which
this country had suffered by the presence of
De Ruyter’s fleet in the Medway, they naturally
looked round for someone to punish. It
was the same feeling, only in a much intensified
degree, which found expression at the time of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
the Crimean war in the cry, “Whom shall we
hang?” A Parliamentary Committee was appointed
in October, 1667, to inquire into everything
relating to this business, at Chatham.
Pepys is warned to prepare himself, as there is
a desire to lay the blame upon the Commissioners
of the Navy, and a resolution “to lay
the fault heavy somewhere, and to punish it.”<a name="Anchor_61" id="Anchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 61.">[61]</a>
He therefore gives as clear a statement as possible,
and satisfies the Committee for a time;
but for months afterwards he is continually being
summoned to answer some charge, so that he is
mad to “become the hackney of this Office in perpetual
trouble and vexation, that need it least.”<a name="Anchor_62" id="Anchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 62.">[62]</a>
Then breaks out a storm in the House of Commons
against the Principal Officers of the Navy,
and some members demand that they be put out
of their places. The result is, that they are
ordered to be heard in their own defence at the
Bar of the House. The whole labour of defence
falls upon Pepys, and he sets to work with a
will to collect his evidence, and to display it in
the most satisfactory manner. He is somewhat
annoyed that the other officers can do little to
help him; but he is proud that they, in spite of
themselves, must rely upon him. The eventful
day (5th March, 1667–68) at last arrives, and,
having first fortified himself with half a pint of
mulled sack and a dram of brandy, our Diarist
stands at the Bar with his fellow-officers. But
here we must use his own words, for it would be
presumptuous to paraphrase the vivid account
he himself gives:&mdash;“After<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span> the Speaker had told
us the dissatisfaction of the House, and read the
Report of the Committee, I began our defence
most acceptably and smoothly, and continued at
it without any hesitation or loss, but with full
scope, and all my reason free about me, as if it
had been at my own table, from that time (about
twelve o’clock) till past three in the afternoon;
and so ended without any interruption from the
Speaker; but we withdrew. And there all my
Fellow-officers and all the world that was within
hearing, did congratulate me, and cry up my
speech as the best thing they ever heard; and
my Fellow-officers were overjoyed in it.” The
orator was congratulated on every side, and the
flattery he received is set down in the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>”
in all good faith. Sir William Coventry addresses
him the next day with the words, “Good
morrow, Mr. Pepys, that must be Speaker of the
Parliament-house;” and the Solicitor-General
protests that he spoke the best of any man in
England. One man says that he would go
twenty miles to hear such another speech; and
another, although he had sat six-and-twenty
years in Parliament, had never heard anything
like it before; and there is much more to the
same effect.</p>

<p>I do not find that Pepys ever distinguished
himself by another speech, although he sat for
several years in the House of Commons; and
there is therefore reason to doubt his oratorical
powers. In fact, it is easy to explain the secret
of his success, for he was speaking on a subject
that he thoroughly understood to an audience
that understood it but imperfectly. Still we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
must give Pepys due credit for his achievement.
He had a bad case, and yet he seems to have converted
his audience. It was here that his clear-headedness
and remarkable powers of arrangement
were brought into play, and having at the
same time his whole soul in the matter, he easily
carried his hearers with him.</p>

<p>The praises he received raised up a strong
desire in his breast to become a Parliament-man.
He hints at this design on the 5th
of December, 1668, and again, on the 19th of
February, 1668–69, he opens the matter to his
friend, Sir William Coventry, who likes the idea
mightily, and promises to speak about it to the
Duke of York. A few more months, and his
eyes&mdash;which already, as we have seen, had given
him trouble&mdash;become so much worse that he
begins to think seriously of taking rest. On the
16th of May, 1669, he draws up a rough copy
of a petition to the Duke of York for leave of
absence for three or four months. A few days
after, the Duke takes him to the King, who expresses
his great concern at the state of his eyes,
and gives him the leave he desires.<a name="Anchor_63" id="Anchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 63.">[63]</a> On the
31st of May, 1669, the pen that has written so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
much to amuse us is put to the paper for the last
time; and the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>” ends with these words of
deep but subdued feeling:&mdash;“And thus ends all
that I doubt I shall ever be able to do with my
own eyes in the keeping of my Journal, I being
not able to do it any longer, having done now
so long as to undo my eyes almost every time
that I take a pen in my hand; and therefore
whatever comes of it I must forbear; and therefore
resolve, from this time forward to have it
kept by my people in longhand, and must be
contented to set down no more than is fit for
them and all the world to know; or if there be
any thing, which cannot be much, now my amours
are past, and my eyes hindering me in almost all
other pleasures, I must endeavour to keep a
margin in my book open, to add here and there,
a note in short-hand with my own hand. And
so I betake myself to that course, which is
almost as much as to see myself go in to my
grave: for which and all the discomforts that
will accompany my being blind, the good God
prepare me!” The “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>” is one of the most
curious of psychological studies, and surely no
other man has so relentlessly laid bare his secret
motives. When he does a good action from a
good motive, he cannot forbear to add a dirty
little motive as well. There is no posing for
effect, such as the writers of confessions adopt,
and herein consists the chief charm of the book.</p>

<p>I cannot pretend to draw the character of the
Diarist, for he has done that himself in his own
vivid manner; but a few of his leading characteristics
may be set down here. Two of the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
prominent of these characteristics are his money-grubbing
and his love of women.</p>

<p>1. <i>Money-grubbing.</i> His paramount anxiety
is to get money, and we find him constantly
making up his accounts in order to see how
much better off he is this month than he was in
the last. He takes care that no opportunity of
money-getting shall be allowed to slip, and he
certainly succeeds in his endeavours; for whereas,
at the opening of the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>,” he is only worth
about <abbr title="40, pounds"><i>£</i>40,</abbr> he makes <abbr title="3,560 pounds"><i>£</i>3,560</abbr> in the year 1665, while
his salary as Clerk of the Acts remains at <abbr title="350 pounds"><i>£</i>350</abbr>.
In the following year he only made <abbr title="2,986 pounds"><i>£</i>2,986</abbr>.<a name="Anchor_64" id="Anchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 64.">[64]</a></p>

<p>The same prudent habits that made Pepys so
careful in casting up his accounts induced him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
make a new will as changes were required. On
the 17th of March, 1659–60, he bequeathed all
that he possessed (but this was not very much at
that time) to his wife, with his French books,
the other books being left to his brother John.
Another will was made on August 10th, 1665,
because the town was so unhealthy “that a man
cannot depend upon living two days.” We have
fuller particulars of the will of May 27th, 1666,
by which Pall Pepys, the Diarist’s sister, was to
have <abbr title="500, pounds"><i>£</i>500,</abbr> his father <abbr title="2,000, pounds"><i>£</i>2,000,</abbr> and his wife the
rest of his estate&mdash;“but to have <abbr title="2,500 pounds"><i>£</i>2,500</abbr> secured
to her though by deducting out of what I
have given my father and sister.” Another will
was prepared in the following year, by which
Pepys left all he possessed to be equally divided
between his wife and father.<a name="Anchor_65" id="Anchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 65.">[65]</a></p>

<p>2. <i>Admiration for women.</i> Some of the
oddest passages in the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>” grew out of
this trait in Pepys’s character; and one can only
marvel that he thought it well to set down such
passages on paper. When he came to Gravesend,
after Charles <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr>’s landing, he kissed “a
good handsome wench,” because she was the first
he had seen for a great while;<a name="Anchor_66" id="Anchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 66.">[66]</a> and, at another
time, the widow of a naval officer came to see
him, apparently on business, when he had “a
kiss or two of her, and a most modest woman
she is.”<a name="Anchor_67" id="Anchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 67.">[67]</a> His gallantry was so great as even to
cause him to kiss the mouth of Katherine of
Valois, whose body was exposed at Westminster
Abbey. He seems to have performed this act<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
with great content, for he notes particularly that
on his birthday, February 23rd, 1668–69 (being
then thirty-six years of age), he “did first kiss a
queen.” Although he was always ready to kiss
the ladies he met, his admiration was often quite
disinterested; this was peculiarly the case with
regard to the two Court beauties, the Duchess of
Richmond and the Countess of Castlemaine, to
neither of whom, apparently, he ever spoke.
There is an odd little entry which he made on
the 9th of September, 1668, that well illustrates
this feeling of his. The Duke of Richmond
wanted to consult Pepys about his yacht, and
sent for him to his lodgings in Whitehall. Pepys
hoped to have seen the Duchess, but found that
she was in the country; so he adds, “I shall
make much of this acquaintance, that I may live
to see his lady near.” But the Clerk of the Acts’
chief admiration was lavished upon the worthless
Countess of Castlemaine. He is always delighted
when he can get a glimpse of her; and
he usually finds the play to be insipid if she does
not grace the theatre with her presence. Even
the sight of her clothes gives him pleasure, for
he tells us that one day, in passing the Privy
Garden at Whitehall, he saw her smocks and
linen petticoats hanging out to dry, and it did
him good to look upon them.<a name="Anchor_68" id="Anchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 68.">[68]</a></p>

<p>Pepys was a pretty regular attendant at
church, and he seems to have enjoyed a good
sermon; but his chief delight was to look about
for pretty women: thus, on the 26th of May,
1667, he went (alone, by-the-bye) to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Margaret’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
Church, Westminster, and there, he says,
“Did entertain myself with my perspective glass
up and down the church, by which I had the
great pleasure of seeing and gazing at a great
many very fine women; and what with that, and
sleeping, I passed away the time till sermon was
done.”</p>

<p>Our hero was very fond of pretty Betty
Michell, and would take some trouble to get a
sight of her; and there is a most ludicrous passage
in the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>” in which he describes a
mistake he made once at church. He went
again to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Margaret’s, in hopes of seeing
Betty, and stayed for an hour in the crowd,
thinking she was there “by the end of a nose”
that he saw; but at last, to his great disgust, the
head turned towards him, and it was only her
mother; he naturally adds, “which vexed me.”<a name="Anchor_69" id="Anchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 69.">[69]</a>
Although he gave his wife much cause to be
jealous, he was inclined, without any cause, to be
jealous of her; and, from his own account, he
seems often to have treated her in a very boorish
manner. One would have liked to have read
the lady’s account of the constant little squabbles
which occurred; but Pepys was not of the same
opinion, for on one occasion, when he found a
paper which his wife had written on the “disagreeables”
of her life, he burnt it, in spite of her remonstrances.<a name="Anchor_70" id="Anchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 70.">[70]</a></p>

<p>Pepys’s nature was singularly contradictory,
and in summing up the chief points of his character,
we can do little more than make a catalogue of
his various qualities, giving the bad ones first, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
then enumerating the good ones as a set-off.
Thus, he was unfaithful to his wife, and a coward,
yet he knew his faults, and could try to amend
them. He was vain, ignorant, credulous, and
superstitious; yet he had scholarly tastes, and
his orderly and business habits were so marked
that they alone would point to him as a man
out of the common run. He was mean, and yet
he was also generous. This seems a harsh verdict,
but it can easily be proved to be true, and
we will proceed to notice the several points
<i>seriatim</i>.</p>

<p>As to his unfaithfulness, his own description
of his conduct towards several women makes it
probable; but, in the instance of Deb Willett,
there can be no doubt. This episode, which
occurred in October and November, 1668, is by
far the most painful one in the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>.”<a name="Anchor_71" id="Anchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 71.">[71]</a> Pepys
appears to have been infatuated, and, in spite of
his struggles, he fell. He repented, and prayed
fervently in his chamber that he might not fall
again. He resolved not to give any new occasion
for his wife’s jealousy, and he found great
peace in his mind by reason of this resolution.<a name="Anchor_72" id="Anchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 72.">[72]</a></p>

<p>He was a coward, for on one occasion he was
so angry with the cookmaid that he kicked her.
He was not sorry for doing this, but he was
vexed that Sir William Penn’s footboy saw him,
and would probably tell the family.<a name="Anchor_73" id="Anchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 73.">[73]</a></p>

<p>His vanity may be taken for granted, as every
line of the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>” shows it. He was ignorant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
of history, for he expected to find an account of
England’s dominion on the sea in “Domesday
Book.”<a name="Anchor_74" id="Anchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 74.">[74]</a> As to his credulity, he appears to have
believed everything that was told him, however
absurd. His superstition is shown in his belief in
charms and in most of the popular delusions of his
time; and also by his subterfuges, as when he
opens a letter, and does not look at it until the
money has fallen out, so that he may be able to
say that he saw no money in the paper, if he
should be questioned about it.<a name="Anchor_75" id="Anchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 75.">[75]</a></p>

<p>He was mean, for he grudges money for his
wife, while he spends liberally on himself; he is
stingy to his father, and dislikes lending money
to the benefactor from whom all his prosperity
originally came. Yet he could be singularly
generous at times. He gave <abbr title="600 pounds"><i>£</i>600</abbr> to his sister
Paulina as her marriage portion;<a name="Anchor_76" id="Anchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 76.">[76]</a> and, after
quarrelling with his wife because she had spent
twenty-five shillings on a pair of earrings without
his leave,<a name="Anchor_77" id="Anchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 77.">[77]</a> he pays <abbr title="80 pounds"><i>£</i>80</abbr> for a necklace which he
presents her with.<a name="Anchor_78" id="Anchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 78.">[78]</a> Of his scholarly tastes and
business habits we shall have an opportunity of
saying somewhat further on.</p>

<p>Perhaps, on the whole, the most remarkable
characteristic of the man was his total want<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
of the imaginative faculty. Here was one
who had been well educated, and had kept up
his learning through life; who had an artistic
taste, and was a thorough musician; who could
not so much as understand true wit or the higher
poetry. “<cite class="plain">Midsummer Night’s Dream</cite>” was insipid
and ridiculous to him,<a name="Anchor_79" id="Anchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 79.">[79]</a> and he found
“<cite class="plain">Hudibras</cite>” so silly that he was ashamed of
it.<a name="Anchor_80" id="Anchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 80.">[80]</a></p>

<p>I must leave my readers to answer the question
why it is that, in spite of all that has been
said, Pepys can stand the ordeal through which
we have passed him; and why it is that, with all
his faults, we cannot put his book down without
some sort of affection for the man?</p>

  “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>,” May 24, 1669. “To Whitehall where I attended
  the Duke of York and was by him led to the King.”
  To this passage Lord Braybrooke added this note: “It
  seems doubtful whether the expression of being led to the
  King has any reference to the defective state of Pepys’s
  vision. Perhaps he might wish to make the most of this
  infirmity, in the hope of strengthening his claim for leave of
  absence.” It is rather too absurd to think that the Duke of
  York would lead Pepys by the hand through the corridors
  of the palace. If a guide had been needed, the services of
  a less august personage could surely have been obtained.

<p class="chapter_name">PEPYS AFTER THE “<cite class="plain">DIARY</cite>.”</p>

<p class="chapter_quote">“Truly may it be said that this was a greater and more
grievous loss to the mind’s eye of his posterity, than to the
bodily organs of Pepys himself. It makes me restless and
discontented to think what a Diary, equal in minuteness
and truth of portraiture to the preceding, from 1669 to 1688
or 1690, would have been for the true causes, process, and
character of the Revolution.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Coleridge’s</span> <abbr title="manuscript">MS.</abbr> note in
his copy of the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>” (“<cite class="plain">Notes and Queries</cite>,” 1st <abbr title="Series">S.</abbr> <abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr>

<p class="drop-cap noindent"><span class="upper-case">We</span> have seen in the previous chapter
how Pepys wrote the last line of his
“<cite>Diary</cite>” on the 31st of May, 1669;
and how, by the physical defect
which had then increased to alarming
proportions, we have suffered what Coleridge
calls “this grievous loss.” In treating of Pepys’s
life after the “<cite>Diary</cite>,” we at once find the difference
between dealing with a few isolated facts
and condensing from the living record of the
man’s own life. Moreover, Pepys as painted by
his friends and as painted by himself, appears
like two different men. The question is&mdash;would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
the highly-respected Secretary of the Admiralty
and the dignified President of the Royal Society
have proved himself of the same nature as was
the officious Clerk of the Acts if the “<cite>Diary</cite>” had
been continued for some twenty or more years?
or did time and domestic affliction mellow and
settle the somewhat turbulent affections of the
Diarist? There seems to be some reason for
taking the latter view, and it is probable that,
when he attained a more mature age, the dross
of meanness was refined away, leaving the native
ore of generosity pure and undefiled. When
Pepys had obtained his leave of absence, he set
out on a tour through France and Holland, accompanied
by his wife. He carried with him on his
journey the love which he always evinced for the
occupation of his life, and he attempted to improve
his knowledge of nautical affairs, making
at the time collections respecting the French
and Dutch navies. Some months after his return
he spoke of his journey as having been
“full of health and content,” but no sooner had
they returned to London than his wife became
seriously ill with a fever. The disease took a
fatal turn, and on the 10th of November, 1669,
Elizabeth Pepys died, at the early age of twenty-nine
years, to the great grief of her husband.
She died at their house in Crutched Friars, and
was buried in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Olave’s Church, where Pepys
erected a tablet to her memory.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pepys occupies so prominent a position
in the “<cite>Diary</cite>,” and her husband, in spite of his
faults, was so truly fond of her, that we must
believe her death gave him a shock from which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
he would be long in recovering. He had no
child nor near connection to be with him, and
therefore, after this sad event, the whole current
of his home life must have been changed.</p>

<p>In this same year, 1669, Sir Robert Brooke,
member of Parliament for the borough of Aldborough,
in Suffolk, died, and Pepys came forward
as a candidate to fill his place. The Duke of York
was favourable, and used all his influence to obtain
the return of the Clerk of the Acts, but without
success. When the election came on, Pepys was
in distress, and his loss prevented him from
taking part in the proceedings; so that, in spite
of all that friends could do for him, he was defeated,
and John Bence was elected on the 9th
of November. In the following year he quarrelled
with Sir James Barkman Leyenburg, the
Swedish Resident in this country, and a duel
between them was only prevented by an order
from the King, given in a letter from Matthew
Wren to Pepys, commanding him not to send
or receive a challenge. This incident is not easy
to be understood, as from what we know of
Pepys he was not a man who would be very
wishful to rush into a hostile encounter. Lord
Braybrooke suggests that, as Leyenburg married
the widow of Sir William Batten, the quarrel may
have related to some money which was owed to
Pepys by Batten, and for which the widow was
liable; but this suggestion can only be taken for
what it is worth.</p>

<p>We do not know the exact date of Pepys’s
appointment to the Secretaryship of the Admiralty,
but in a document found among his manuscripts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
and dated November 3, 1672, he is described
as holding that office.<a name="Anchor_81" id="Anchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 81.">[81]</a> When he was thus
raised in his official position he was able to obtain
his old place of Clerk of the Acts for his own
clerk, Thomas Hayter, and his brother, John
Pepys, who held it jointly. The latter does not
appear to have done much credit to Samuel.
He took holy orders in 1666,<a name="Anchor_82" id="Anchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 82.">[82]</a> and was appointed
clerk to the Trinity House in 1670.
When he died, in 1677, he was in debt <abbr title="300 pounds"><i>£</i>300</abbr> to
the corporation, which Samuel had to pay.</p>

<p>Pepys’s kind patron and kinsman the Earl of
Sandwich died heroically in the naval action in
Solebay, and on June 24, 1672, his funeral was
performed with some pomp. There were eleven
earls among the mourners, and Pepys, as the
first among “the six Bannerrolles,” walked in the
procession. This same year there was some
talk of the elevation to the peerage of Sir Robert
Paston, M. P. for Castle Rising, and the Duke
of York at once thought of Pepys as a candidate
for his seat. The influence of Lord Howard,
who had done what he could at Aldborough,
was pre-eminent at Castle Rising; and James at
once spoke to him to obtain his interest. Lord
Howard was, however, in somewhat of a fix,
for according to a letter which Thomas Povey
wrote Pepys on August 31st, 1672, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>“he stands
engaged to the King for Sir Francis North,
to the Duchess of Cleveland for Sir John Trevor,
her counsel and feoffee, and to the Duke
for” Pepys. Time, however, got the peer out
of his dilemma. First of all, Sir Robert Stewart,
a Master of Chancery and the other member for
the borough, died, and Trevor was elected in his
place; then North was put in for King’s Lynn;
and lastly, when Paston was created Viscount
Yarmouth, Pepys was chosen to succeed him,
on the 4th of November, 1673. Mr. Offley, his
unsuccessful opponent, petitioned against the
return, and the Committee of Privilege determined
the election to be void; but Parliament
being prorogued shortly afterwards, before any
decision had been come to by the House, Pepys
was permitted to retain his seat. The journals
of the House<a name="Anchor_83" id="Anchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 83.">[83]</a> contain a full account of the proceedings,
which chiefly consisted of evidence
respecting a frivolous charge made against
Pepys. It was reported that a person of quality
(who turned out to be Lord Shaftesbury) had
seen an altar with a crucifix upon it in his
house. When called upon, Shaftesbury denied
that he had ever seen “an altar in Mr. Pepys’s
house or lodgings; as to the crucifix,” he said he
had “some imperfect memory of seeing somewhat
which he conceived to be a crucifix.”<a name="Anchor_84" id="Anchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 84.">[84]</a>
Pepys stood up in his place and flatly denied
“that he had ever had any altar, or crucifix, or
the image or picture of any saint whatsoever in
his home from the top to the bottom of it.”<a name="Anchor_85" id="Anchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 85.">[85]</a> He
further explained what might have given cause
for the aspersion. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>“Because he could not go
much abroad, he has made his home as pleasant
to himself as he could, embellishing it with
painting. He has a small table in his closet, with
a Bible and Common Prayer-book upon it, and
‘The Whole Duty of Man,’ a bason and an ewer,
and his wife’s picture over it, done by Lombard.
This is the whole thing talked of for an altar.”<a name="Anchor_86" id="Anchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 86.">[86]</a></p>

<p>It appears from the endorsement of a letter
from Balthasar <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michel</span> to Pepys, to which
allusion has already been made, that the latter
was actually charged with having turned Mrs.
Pepys from a Protestant to a Roman Catholic.
Pepys therefore obtained from her brother an
account of the fortunes of their family, which
shows the utter absurdity of any such imputations.<a name="Anchor_87" id="Anchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 87.">[87]</a>
He was always a true Protestant,
although there is some reason for believing that
Mrs. Pepys was a Catholic at heart.<a name="Anchor_88" id="Anchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 88.">[88]</a> On the passing

resigned all his employments; and the Admiralty
being put in commission, Pepys, as secretary,
was brought in immediate correspondence with
Charles <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr></p>

<p>In 1677<a name="Anchor_89" id="Anchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 89.">[89]</a> he was elected Master of the Clothworkers’
Company, when he presented a richly-chased
silver cup, which is still used at their
dinners. He was not long allowed to remain
in peace, for the charge of popery, which was
first made in 1673, was frequently repeated,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
and in 1679 he was accused, on the depositions
of Colonel John Scott, of betraying the navy, by
sending secret particulars to the French Government;
and also of a design to dethrone the King
and extirpate the Protestant religion. He and
Sir Anthony Deane were committed to the
Tower under the Speaker’s warrant on May
22nd, and Pepys’s place at the Admiralty was
filled up by the appointment of Thomas Hayter.
When the two prisoners were brought to the
bar of the King’s Bench on the 2nd of June,
the Attorney-General refused bail; but subsequently
they were allowed to find security for
<abbr title="30,000 pounds"><i>£</i>30,000</abbr>. At length, after several months of delay,
it was found that Colonel Scott refused to
acknowledge to the truth of the original deposition;
and the prisoners were relieved from their
bail on February 12th, 1679–80. Scott turned
out to be a blackguard. He is said to have
cheated the States of Holland out of <abbr title="7,000, pounds"><i>£</i>7,000,</abbr> in
consequence of which he was hanged in effigy
at the Hague, in 1672; and in 1681 he fled
from England to escape from the law, as he
had been found guilty of wilful murder for
killing a coachman. James, a butler, previously
in Pepys’s service, confessed on his deathbed, in
1680, that he had trumped up the whole story
relating to his former master’s change of religion
at the instigation of Mr. Harbord, M.P. for
Launceston, a leading enemy of Pepys.<a name="Anchor_90" id="Anchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 90.">[90]</a></p>

<p>Evelyn visited Pepys in the Tower, and
expressed his belief in the unjustness of the
charge. While he was in custody Pepys kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
up a correspondence with the Duke of York,
who was then abroad, and he received an application
from a Mr. D’Oyly for a loan of <abbr title="50 pounds"><i>£</i>50</abbr>; but
he was obliged to answer that he himself had
been forced to borrow <abbr title="100 pounds"><i>£</i>100</abbr> from friends, to
pay his fees and defray his expenses while in
durance. It is impossible not to respect Pepys
for his conduct towards James when the Royal
Duke was in disgrace. He certainly made
enemies by his action, and one of these was
Andrew Marvell, who is reputed to have published
a “Black Book” entitled, “A List of the
principal labourers in the great design of Popery
and arbitrary Power,” which contains the following
vituperative entry: “Castle Rising&mdash;Samuel
Pepys Esquire, once a taylor, then a serving
man to Lord Sandwich, now Secretary to the
Admiralty, got by passes and other illegal wages
<abbr title="40,000 pounds"><i>£</i>40,000</abbr>.” We know these assertions to be
untrue, but they probably did the victim as
much harm as if they had been true.</p>

<p>Pepys was chosen by the electors of Harwich
as their member in the short Parliament that
sat from March to July, 1679, his colleague being
Sir Anthony Deane; but both members were
superseded in the next Parliament, that met on
the 17th of October, 1679.</p>

<p>In 1680 Pepys attended on Charles <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> at
Newmarket, and there he took down, from the
King’s own mouth, the narrative of his escape
after the Battle of Worcester, which now remains
in the Pepysian Library, both in shorthand
and longhand.</p>

<p>Sir Thomas Page, the Provost of King’s
College, Cambridge, died in August, 1681; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
S. Maryon, a Fellow of Clare, wrote at once,
suggesting that Pepys was a fit and proper
person for the post, and urging him to apply to
the King for it. Pepys replied that he believed
Colonel Legge (afterwards Lord Dartmouth)
wanted to get the office for an old tutor. Although
he pretended unfitness, he evidently liked the
idea; and in a letter to Legge, while recommending
an early application for the tutor, he expresses
himself as willing to take the Provostship
if the tutor cannot get it. He also promises,
if he should be chosen, to give the whole profit
of the first year, and at least half of that of each
succeeding year, to “be dedicated to the general
and public use of the college.”<a name="Anchor_91" id="Anchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 91.">[91]</a> In the end Dr.
John Copleston was appointed to the post.</p>

<p>In May, 1682, Pepys accompanied the Duke
of York to Scotland, and narrowly escaped shipwreck
by the way. Before letters could arrive
in London to tell of his safety, the news came of
the wreck of the “Gloucester” (the Duke’s ship),
and of the loss of many lives. His friends’
anxiety was relieved by the arrival of a letter
which Pepys wrote from Edinburgh to Hewer
on the 8th inst., in which he detailed the particulars
of the adventure. The Duke invited him
to go on board the “Gloucester,” but he preferred
his own yacht, in which he had more room,
and in consequence of his resolution he saved
himself from the risk of drowning. On the 5th
of May, about five in the morning, the frigate
struck upon the sand called “The Lemon and
the Oar,” about sixteen leagues from the mouth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
of the Humber, through the carelessness of the
pilot, it was said. The Duke and his party were
all asleep at the time, and after they were
awoke it is supposed that they remained so
long on board in the hope of saving the ship,
that more men were drowned than otherwise
need have been. It is said that the sinking
sailors gave a loud huzza for the Duke, although
they perhaps owed their deaths to an error of
judgment on his part. Pepys writes that, had the
said wreck occurred two hours earlier, and the accompanying
yachts been at the distance they had
previously been, not a soul would have escaped.
Pepys on his arrival in Edinburgh was allowed
by the Duke to attend one or two of the councils,
and he was greatly struck with the union of absoluteness
and gentleness by which James maintained
his authority. He then made a tour
through some of the Scottish towns with Colonel
Legge, being most pleased with the “beauty and
trade” of Glasgow. The people were not to
his liking, for he writes to Hewer: “The truth
is, there is so universal a rooted nastiness hangs
about the person of every Scot (man and woman)
that renders the finest show they can make
nauseous, even among those of the first quality.”<a name="Anchor_92" id="Anchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 92.">[92]</a></p>

<p>The time was now coming when Pepys was
to be again employed officially, and on July 30,
1683, he left London for Portsmouth, in order
to join his old friend Colonel Legge (now Lord
Dartmouth) in his expedition to Tangier for
the purpose of demolishing that place. Pepys
kept a journal of his proceedings, which is now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
in the Bodleian Library at Oxford, and has been
printed by the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> John Smith in his “Life,
Journals, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, of Pepys.” As the <a href="#Ref_Chapter_IV" title="Go to reference">next chapter</a> is
devoted particularly to Tangier, it is not necessary
to do more here than remark that, although
this journal is of considerable interest, it falls
very far short of the <i>naïveté</i> and charm of the
original “<cite>Diary</cite>.” On March 29th, 1684, Lord
Dartmouth and his party (including Pepys)
arrived in the English Channel.</p>

<p>Shortly after this, Charles <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> made some
further alterations at the Admiralty, and appointed
Pepys to his old place of Secretary, possession
of which he kept until the Revolution,
when friends of the banished prince were not
likely to be in favour. This same year he was
elected President of the Royal Society, an office
which he held for two years, apparently with
credit to himself and general satisfaction to the
Fellows. He certainly was not a scientific man,
but at that period most of the subjects discussed
could be understood by an intelligent man; and
Pepys had a sincere love for curious learning
which made him peculiarly fitted to act the part
of an imitation Mecænas. In 1685 Charles <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr>
died, and James came to the throne. We have
already seen how Pepys was a spectator at
Charles’s coronation, now he was to take the
position of an actor. We find that he marched
in the procession at James’s coronation, immediately
behind the King’s canopy, as one of the
sixteen barons of the Cinque Ports. A Parliament
was summoned to meet on the 19th of
May, and Pepys was elected both by the burgesses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
of Harwich and by those of Sandwich.
He chose to serve for Harwich, and Sir Philip
Parker, Bart., was elected to fill his place at
Sandwich. This Parliament was dissolved by
proclamation, July 2nd, 1687, and on August
24th, the King declared in Council that another
Parliament should be summoned for November
27th, 1688, the writs to bear date September 5th;
but they were recalled on news being received
of the Prince of Orange’s design. On December
10th, James ordered those writs which had not
been sent out to be burned; and the same night,
on his going away from Whitehall, he threw the
Great Seal into the water. The <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Alexander
Mills, a friend of Pepys, wrote to him from Sandwich
in July, 1687, after the news of the dissolution
had arrived, to say that he thought that Pepys
might again be chosen if he felt inclined to stand
for the town. In the next few months a great
change had come over public affairs, and when
the Convention Parliament was called together
in January and February, 1689–90, Pepys found
no place in it. In 1688 he had some correspondence
with the Mayor of Harwich respecting the
removal of the Custom-house from Ipswich to
Harwich, and his chances of election seemed
good at that time; but a few months changed
all that, and the corporation did not care to be
represented by an official of the late King:
so when the election came on, someone called
out in the street, “No Tower men, no men out
of the Tower!” His public career was closed
soon after this, for an order was made out by the
Commissioners of the Admiralty on the 9th of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
March, 1688–89, commanding him to give up
his books, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, to Phineas Bowles, the newly-appointed
Secretary of the Admiralty. He still
retained hopes of a return to public life, and on
the 8th of February, 1689–90, he wrote to the
proud Sir Edward Seymour for “his interest
anywhere, by which I might compass an election”
for the new Parliament.<a name="Anchor_93" id="Anchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 93.">[93]</a> What Seymour’s
answer was we do not know, but we do know
that a few months afterwards (June, 1690) Pepys
was committed to the Gate-house at Westminster,
upon pretence of his being affected to King
James; but he was soon permitted to return to
his own home on account of ill-health. On this
occasion four stanch friends&mdash;Sir Peter Palavicini,
Mr. James Houblon, Mr. Blackburne, and
Mr. Martin&mdash;were bail for him. Soon after, he
published his “Memoirs of the Navy,” to show
what he had done for its improvement and government,
but although he was on all sides
looked up to as the greatest authority on naval
affairs, he continued, even in 1692, to apprehend
some fresh persecution.</p>

<p>Pepys had never been a healthy man, and as
years began to tell upon him he suffered much.
One day, when he was at Tangier, he was
frightened by the old swimming in the head
coming over him, and this made him melancholy.<a name="Anchor_94" id="Anchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 94.">[94]</a>
In December, 1686, he was again troubled with
pain night and day, caused by the complaint for
which he was successfully operated upon before
the “<cite>Diary</cite>” commences. In a letter to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
brother-in-law, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michel</span>, he expresses the
opinion that a general decay of his stomach and
system will soon bring his life to an end; but he
had several years still to live.</p>

<p>About this time Pepys secured the services of
a Mrs. Fane as his housekeeper, and of her he
wrote, in 1689: “I do not believe that a more
knowing, faithful, or vigilant person, or a stricter
keeper at home (which is to me a great addition)&mdash;a
person more useful in sickness as well as
health, than Mrs. Fane is, can anywhere be
found. As such I esteem and love her with
all my heart, and should ever desire to keep her
acquaintance, friendship, and neighbourhood.”
But&mdash;and this is a very important reservation&mdash;Mrs.
Fane had a very disagreeable temper, as
her victim goes on to say: “She hath a height
of spirit, captiousness of humour, and bitterness
and noise of tongue, that of all womankind I
have hitherto had to do withal, do render her
conversation and comportment as a servant most
insupportable.”<a name="Anchor_95" id="Anchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 95.">[95]</a> He parted with her once, but
Mrs. Skinner prevailed upon him to receive her
again. At last, after forbearance for three years
and a-half, she was obliged to leave finally. Mr.
James Houblon pleaded for her, but when he
heard the above explanation, he was unable to
say more.</p>

<p>In 1700, Pepys removed from York Buildings
to what his friend Evelyn calls his “Paradisian
Clapham.” Here he lived with his old clerk and
friend, William Hewer, but his infirmities kept
him constantly in the house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>The eminent Dr. John Wallis, Savilian Professor
of Geometry in the University of Oxford,
was highly esteemed by Pepys, who had known
him for many years as one of the most distinguished
Fellows of the Royal Society. In 1701,
therefore, the Diarist matured a scheme which
did him the greatest credit. He sent Sir Godfrey
Kneller down to Oxford to paint the old
man’s portrait; and, when it was finished, he
presented the picture to the University of Oxford,
and received in exchange a Latin diploma
thanking him in gorgeous language for his
munificence. Pepys explained to Kneller that
it had long been his wish to provide from the
painter’s hands a means of “immortalizing the
memory of the person&mdash;for his fame can never
die&mdash;of that great man and my most honoured
friend, Dr. Wallis, to be lodged as an humble
present of mine, though a Cambridge man, to
my dear aunt, the University of Oxford.”</p>

<p>So much for the donor. The painter, on his
part, was proud of his work, and assured Pepys
that he had never done a better picture, if so
good a one, in his life before.</p>

<p>In the following year all was over with both
Wallis and Pepys. On the 26th of May, 1703,
Samuel Pepys, after long-continued suffering,
breathed his last, in the presence of the learned
Dr. George Hickes, the non-juring Dean of
Worcester, who writes as follows of the death-bed:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>“The greatness of his behaviour, in his
long and sharp tryall before his death, was in
every respect answerable to his great life; and I
believe no man ever went out of this world with
greater contempt of it, or a more lively faith in
every thing that was revealed of the world to
come. I administered the Holy Sacrament
twice in his illnesse to him, and had administered
it a third time but for a sudden fit of illness
that happened at the appointed time of
administering of it. Twice I gave him the absolution
of the church, which he desired, and
received with all reverence and comfort, and I
never attended any sick or dying person that
dyed with so much Christian greatnesse of mind,
or a more lively sense of immortality, or so
much fortitude and patience, in so long and
sharp a tryall, or greater resignation to the Will
which he most devoutly acknowledged to be the
wisdom of God: and I doubt not but he is now
a very blessed spirit, according to his motto,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mens cujusque is est quisque</i>.”</p>

<p>It was found necessary to have a post-mortem
examination of his body, when a nest of seven
stones, weighing about four and a-half ounces,
was found in the left kidney, which was entirely
ulcerated. His constitution generally, however,
appears to have been strong. The body was
brought from Clapham, and buried in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Olave’s
Church, Crutched Friars, on the 5th of June,
at nine o’clock in the evening, in a vault close
by the monument erected to Mrs. Pepys.</p>

<p>John Jackson, Pepys’s nephew, sent a suit of
mourning to Evelyn, and expressed his sorrow
that distance and his correspondent’s health
would prevent him from assisting at the holding-up
of the pall.</p>

<p>It appears from a list printed at the end of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
Pepys’s correspondence, that mourning was given
to forty persons, and that forty-five rings at 20<i><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></i>,
sixty-two at 15<i><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></i>, and sixteen at 10<i><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></i> were distributed
to relations, godchildren, servants, and
friends; also to representatives of the Royal
Society, of the Universities of Cambridge and
Oxford, of the Admiralty, and of the Navy
Office. The bulk of the property was bequeathed
to John Jackson, the son of Mrs. Jackson, the
Pall Pepys of the “Diary;” but the money which
was left was much less than might have been
expected. In spite of all his public services,
which were universally acknowledged, he received
neither pension nor remuneration of any
kind after his enforced retirement at the Revolution.
Public men in those days, without
private property, must have starved if they had
not taken fees, for the King had no idea of
wasting his money by paying salaries. At the
time of Pepys’s death there was a balance of
<abbr title="28,007 pounds 2 shillings and a penny farthing"><i>£</i>28,007 2<i>s.</i> 1¼<i>d.</i></abbr> due to him from the Crown,
and the original vouchers still remain an heirloom
in the family.</p>

<p class="drop-cap noindent"><span class="upper-case">Pepys</span> was so intimately connected
with the government of Tangier
during the twenty-two years it
remained in the possession of the
English, that it seems necessary,
in a memoir of him, to give some account of
the history of the place during that period.</p>

<p>Tangier is a seaport, on a small bay or inlet
of the Straits of Gibraltar, which affords the
only good harbour for shipping on the sea-board
of Morocco, an extent of coast of about 900
miles. The town was early coveted by the
Portuguese, and in 1437 their army attacked it,
but were defeated beneath the walls. On this
occasion Dom Fernando, the King’s brother, was
left behind as a hostage. A treaty of peace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
was concluded, but the stipulations not being
executed, the Moors threw Dom Fernando into
prison, where he died. The prince’s body was
treated with insult, and hung up by the heels
over the city walls. A few years later this
unworthy conduct was revenged, for in 1463,
the Portuguese being successful in battle,
Alonzo <abbr title="the Fifth">V.</abbr> took the town from the Moors. For
two centuries the Portuguese kept possession,
but about the period of our Restoration they found
the place somewhat of an encumbrance, and were
anxious to obtain a desirable alliance against
their enemies the Spaniards, by transferring it
to another power. In November, 1660, Thomas
Maynard, British Consul at Lisbon, writing to
Sir Edward Nicholas, says, that the King of
Portugal would part with Tangier to England
on reasonable terms.<a name="Anchor_96" id="Anchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 96.">[96]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Shortly afterwards the Portuguese ambassador
in London proposed the Infanta Katharine,
daughter of that Duke of Braganza who became
King of Portugal as Joam <abbr title="the Fourth">IV.</abbr>, as a wife for
Charles <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr>, offering at the same time a portion
of half a million pounds sterling (“almost double
what any King [of England] had ever received
in money by any marriage”),<a name="Anchor_97" id="Anchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 97.">[97]</a> and in addition a
grant of a free trade in Brazil and the East
Indies, and the possession of Tangier and the
Island of Bombay. The ambassador observed
that these two places “might reasonably be
valued above the portion in money.”<a name="Anchor_98" id="Anchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 98.">[98]</a> It was
supposed that the possession of Tangier would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
be of infinite benefit to England and a security
to her trade, and the Earl of Sandwich and Sir
John Lawson were consulted respecting the
proposed acquisition. Lord Sandwich said
that if the town were walled and fortified with
brass, it would yet repay the cost, but he only
knew it from the sea. Lawson had been in it,
and said that it was a place of that importance,
that if it were in the hands of Hollanders they
would quickly make a mole, which could easily
be done. Then ships would ride securely in
all weathers, and we could keep the place
against the world, and give the law to the trade
of the Mediterranean.<a name="Anchor_99" id="Anchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 99.">[99]</a> The Portuguese were
delighted at the prospect of a marriage between
the Infanta and Charles, and after a few hitches
the treaty was concluded, but some murmurs
were heard against the delivery of Tangier into
the hands of heretics. <span lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">Dom Fernando de
Menezes</span>, the Governor, entreated the Queen
Regent to spare him the grief of handing over
the city to the enemies of the Catholic faith.
He was given to understand that, if he obeyed
instructions, a marquisate would be conferred
upon him, but if he continued to resist he would
be dismissed. Upon this, <span lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">Dom Fernando</span> threw
up his command.</p>

<p>Lord Sandwich was instructed to take possession
of Tangier, and then convey the Infanta
and her portion to England. Although the
Queen Regent sent a governor whom she had
chosen as one devoted to her interest, and sure
to obey her commands, yet Clarendon affirms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
that he went to his government with a contrary
resolution.<a name="Anchor_100" id="Anchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 100.">[100]</a> This resolution, however, was frustrated
by the action of the Moors. A few days
only before Lord Sandwich arrived, the Governor
marched out of the town with all the horse and
half the foot of the garrison, and fell into an
ambush. The whole party were cut off, and
the Governor and many of his chief men were
killed. The town was so weak that, when Lord
Sandwich arrived at this conjuncture, he was
hailed as a deliverer from the Moors. He
conveyed the remainder of the garrison into
Portugal, and Henry, second Earl of Peterborough,
with the English garrison, entered the
town on the 30th of January, 1662, as the first
Governor from England.</p>

<p>Now began a system of mismanagement
worthy of the disorganized condition of public
affairs. A commission was appointed for the
purpose of carrying on the government of
Tangier in London, and constant meetings were
held. None of the commissioners knew anything
of the place, and they were quite at the
mercy of the governors and deputy-governors
who were sent out. Pepys was placed upon the
commission by the influence of Lord Sandwich,
and John Creed was appointed secretary.<a name="Anchor_101" id="Anchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 101.">[101]</a>
Thomas Povey, the treasurer, got his accounts
into so great a muddle, that he thought it wise
to surrender his office to Pepys, on condition of
receiving half the profits, which he did on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
March 20, 1664–65. This treasurership and the
contract for victualling the garrison of Tangier
were sources of considerable profit to our
Diarist. At one of the earliest meetings of the
committee, the project of forming a mole or
breakwater was entertained. A contract for
the work to be done at 13<i><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></i> the cubical yard
was accepted, although, as Pepys writes, none
of the committee knew whether they gave too
much or too little (February 16, 1662–63);
and he signed the contract with very ill will
on that score (March 30, 1663). When the accounts
were looked into on April 3, 1663, it
was found that the charge for one year’s work
would be as much as <abbr title="13,000 pounds"><i>£</i>13,000</abbr>. Two years
after this, the committee agreed to pay 4<i><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></i> a
yard more, and the whole amount spent upon
the mole was found to be <abbr title="36,000 pounds"><i>£</i>36,000</abbr> (March
30, 1665). The wind and sea exerted a very
destructive influence over this structure, although
it was very strongly built, and Colonel Norwood
reported in 1668 that a breach had been made
in the mole which would cost a considerable
sum to repair. As Norwood was an enemy of a
friend of his, Pepys at once jumps to the conclusion
that he must be a bad man (February 22,
1668–69). The second Earl of Carnarvon said
that wood was an excrescence of the earth,
provided by God for the payment of debts, and
Sir W. Coventry, in a conversation with Pepys,
applied this saying to Tangier and its governors.
It is not always safe to take for granted
all that our Diarist says against the persons he
writes about, but there must have been some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
truth in the indictment he drew up against
all those who undertook the government of
Tangier. When Lord Peterborough received
the place from the Portuguese, a book was given
to him which contained a secret account of all
the conduit-heads and heads of watercourses in
and about the town. This book was always
given from one governor to another, but was
not to be looked at by anyone else. When
Lord Peterborough left, he took the book away
with him, and on being asked for it always
answered that he had mislaid it and could not
recover it. Colonel Kirke told Pepys in 1683
that the supply of water was greatly reduced
by the want of this information.<a name="Anchor_102" id="Anchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 102.">[102]</a> In 1666
Pepys had applied the adjective “ignoble” to
Lord Peterborough’s name, on account of his
lordship’s conduct in regard to money matters.
On December 15, 1662, Andrew Lord Rutherford
and Earl of Teviot, Governor of Dunkirk
until its surrender to the French, was appointed
Governor of Tangier in succession to Lord
Peterborough, who was recalled. He was a
brave but rash man, and made a practice of
going out of the town into the country without
taking proper precautions. In May, 1664, he
was surveying his lines after an attack by the
Moors, when he and nineteen officers were killed
by a party of the enemy in ambush. Pepys
called him a cunning man, and said that had
he lived he would have undone the place; but
in 1683, Dr. Lawrence told Pepys that his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
death was a great misfortune, for he took every
opportunity of making the place great, but without
neglecting himself.<a name="Anchor_103" id="Anchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 103.">[103]</a> John Lord Bellassis
was the next governor, and he was said to be
corrupt in his command.</p>

<p>The deputy-governors were no better than
their superiors. Of Colonel Fitzgerald, Pepys
writes, on October 20th, 1664, he is “a man of
no honour nor presence, nor little honesty, and
endeavours to raise the Irish and suppress the
English interest there, and offend every body.”
Certainly, when he sees him on August 7th,
1668, he is pleased with him and his discourse.
Pepys’s opinion of Colonel Norwood we have
already seen; but none of the governors rose to
the height of villany exhibited by Colonel Kirke,
whose name is condemned to everlasting infamy
in the pages of Macaulay.</p>

<p>The further history of Tangier, previous to
its final destruction, can be put into a few words.
In January, 1668–69, Lord Sandwich proposed
that a paymaster should be appointed at Tangier,
and suggested Sir Charles Harbord for the
post; but the Duke of York said that nothing
could be done without Pepys’s consent, in case
the arrangement should injure him in his office
of treasurer. Our Diarist was much pleased at
this instance of the kindness of the Duke, and of
the whole committee towards him.<a name="Anchor_104" id="Anchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 104.">[104]</a></p>

<p>Henry Sheres, who accompanied Lord Sandwich
to Spain, and afterwards became a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
friend of Pepys, was paid <abbr title="100, pounds"><i>£</i>100,</abbr> on January
18th, 1668–69, for drawing a plate of the Tangier
fortifications. In the same year (1669), the
great engraver, Hollar, was sent to Tangier
by the King to take views of the town and
fortifications. Some of these he afterwards engraved,
and the original drawings are in the
British Museum.</p>

<p>In 1673 a new commission was appointed,
and Pepys and Povey were among the commissioners.<a name="Anchor_105" id="Anchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 105.">[105]</a>
Two years afterwards the vessel in
which Henry Teonge was chaplain anchored in
Tangier Bay; and in the “<cite>Diary</cite>” which he
left behind him he gives a description of the
town as it appeared to him. The mole was not
then finished, and he found the old high walls
much decayed in places. He mentions “a pitiful
palizado, not so good as an old park pale (for
you may anywhere almost thrust it down with
your foot);” but in this palisade were twelve forts,
well supplied with good guns.</p>

<p>In 1680, Tangier was besieged by the Emperor
of Morocco, and Charles <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> applied to Parliament
for money, so that the place might be properly
defended. The House of Commons expressed
their dislike of the management of the
garrison, which they suspected to be a nursery
for a Popish army. Sir William Jones said:
“Tangier may be of great importance to trade,
but I am afraid hath not been so managed as to
be any security to the Protestant religion;” and
William Harbord, M.P. for Thetford, added:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
“When we are assured we shall have a good
Protestant governor and garrison in Tangier, I
shall heartily give my vote for money for it.”<a name="Anchor_106" id="Anchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 106.">[106]</a></p>

<p>A most unworthy action was at this time
perpetrated by the Government. Not having
the support of Parliament, they were unable
to defend the place with an adequate force;
and they chose the one man in England
whose brilliant career rivals those of the grand
worthies of Elizabeth’s reign to fight a losing
game.</p>

<p>The Earl of Ossory, son of the Duke of Ormond,
was appointed Governor and General of
the Forces; but, before he could embark, he fell
ill from brooding over the treatment he had
received, and soon after died. Lord Sunderland
said in council that “Tangier must necessarily
be lost; but that it was fit Lord Ossory should
be sent, that they might give some account of it
to the world.”</p>

<p>The Earl left his wife at their daughter’s
house, and came up to London. Here he made
a confidant of John Evelyn, who records in his
“<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>” his opinion of the transaction. It was
not only <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>“an hazardous adventure, but, in most
men’s opinion, an impossibility, seeing there was
not to be above 3 or 400 horse, and 4000 foot
for the garrison and all, both to defend the town,
form a camp, repulse the enemy, and fortify
what ground they should get in. This <abbr title="touched">touch’d</abbr>
my Lord deeply that he should be so little <abbr title="considered">consider’d</abbr>
as to put him on a business in which he
should probably not only lose his reputation,
but be charged with all the miscarriages and ill
success.”<a name="Anchor_107" id="Anchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 107.">[107]</a> It was on this man that Ormond pronounced
the beautiful eulogy, “I would not exchange
my dead son for any living son in
Christendom!”</p>

<p>In August, 1683, Lord Dartmouth was constituted
Captain-General of his Majesty’s Forces
in Africa, and Governor of Tangier, being sent
with a fleet of about twenty sail to demolish and
blow up the works, destroy the harbour, and
bring home the garrison; but his instructions
were secret. Pepys received the King’s command
to accompany Lord Dartmouth, but without
being informed of the object of the expedition.
In a letter to Evelyn, Pepys tells him, “What
our work is I am not solicitous to learn nor forward
to make griefs at, it being handled by our
masters as a secret.” When they get to sea,
Lord Dartmouth tells Pepys the object of the
voyage, which the latter says he never suspected,
having written the contrary to Mr. Houblon.<a name="Anchor_108" id="Anchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 108.">[108]</a>
On September 17th they landed at Tangier,
having been about a month on their voyage.
All the doings on board ship, and the business
transacted on shore, are related with all Pepys’s
vivid power of description in his “<cite class="plain">Tangier
Journal</cite>.” The writer, however, has become
more sedate, and only once “the old man” appears,
when he remarks on the pleasure he had in
“again seeing fine Mrs. Kirke,”<a name="Anchor_109" id="Anchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 109.">[109]</a> the wife of the
Governor. We are told that “the tyranny and
vice of Kirke is stupendous,”<a name="Anchor_110" id="Anchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 110.">[110]</a> and the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>“Journal”
is full of the various instances of his enormities.
Macaulay, however, with that power of characterization
which he so eminently possessed, has
compressed them all into his picture of the leader
of “Kirke’s lambs.”</p>

<p>Pepys was now for the first time in the town
with the government of which he had been so
long connected, and he was astonished at its
uselessness. Day by day he finds out new disadvantages;
and he says that the King was kept
in ignorance of them, in order that successive
governors might reap the benefits of their position.
He complains that even Mr. Sheres was
silent for his own profit, as he might have made
known the evils of the place ten years before.<a name="Anchor_111" id="Anchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 111.">[111]</a></p>

<p>In a letter to Mr. Houblon, he gives his
opinion that “at no time there needed any more
than the walking once round it by daylight to
convince any man (no better-sighted than I) of
the impossibility of our ever making it, under
our circumstances of government, either tenable
by, or useful to, the crown of England.” He
adds: “Therefore it seems to me a matter much
more unaccountable how the King was led to
the reception, and, afterwards, to so long and
chargeable a maintaining, than, at this day, to the
deserting and extinguishing it.”<a name="Anchor_112" id="Anchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 112.">[112]</a></p>

<p>On the other side Mr. Charles Russell wrote
to Pepys from Cadiz, deprecating the destruction
of Tangier, and pointing out the advantages of
possessing it.<a name="Anchor_113" id="Anchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 113.">[113]</a> Sheres also showed Pepys a
paper containing the ordinary objections made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
against the mole, “improved the most he could,
to justify the King’s destroying it,” and added
that he could answer them all.<a name="Anchor_114" id="Anchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 114.">[114]</a></p>

<p>When the work of destruction was begun, it
was found that the masonry had been so well
constructed that it formed a protection as strong
as solid rock. The mining was undertaken piecemeal,
and it took six months to blow up the
whole structure. The rubbish of the mole and
the walls was thrown into the harbour, so as to
choke it up completely. Still the ruined mole
stands, and on one side the accumulated sand
has formed a dangerous reef.</p>

<p>On the 5th of March, 1683–84, Lord Dartmouth
and Pepys sailed out of Tangier Bay, and abandoned
the place to the Moors. Shortly afterwards
the Emperor of Morocco (Muly Ismael)
wrote to Captain Cloudesley Shovel: “God be
praised! you have quitted Tangier, and left it to
us to whom it did belong. From henceforward
we shall manure it, for it is the best part of our
dominions. As for the captives, you may do
with them as you please, heaving them into the
sea, or destroying them otherways.” To which
Shovel replied: <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>“If they are to be disowned because
they are poor, the Lord help them! Your
Majesty tells us we may throw them overboard
if we please. All this we very well know; but
we are Christians, and they bear the form of
men, which is reason enough for us not to do it.
As to Tangier, our master kept it twenty-one
years; and, in spite of all your force, he could,
if he had pleased, have continued it to the world’s
end; for he levelled your walls, filled up your
harbour, and demolished your houses, in the
face of your Alcade and his army; and when
he had done, he left your barren country without
the loss of a man, for your own people to
starve in.”<a name="Anchor_115" id="Anchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 115.">[115]</a></p>

<p>According to Pepys’s account Tangier was a
sink of corruption, and England was well rid of
the encumbrance. He describes the inhabitants
as given up to all kinds of vice, “swearing, cursing
and drinking,” the women being as bad as
the men; and he says that a certain captain belonging
to the Ordnance told him that “he was
quite ashamed of what he had heard in their
houses; worse a thousand times than in the
worst place in London he was ever in.” Dr.
Balaam, a former Recorder, had so poor an
opinion of the people of the place, that he left
his estate to a servant, with the caution that if
he married a woman of Tangier, or one that ever
had been there, he should lose it all.<a name="Anchor_116" id="Anchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 116.">[116]</a></p>

<p>Yet Tangier was positively outdone in iniquity
by Bombay, which Sir John Wyborne calls “a
cursed place.”<a name="Anchor_117" id="Anchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 117.">[117]</a> These were the two acquisitions
so highly rated when Charles <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> married
the Infanta of Portugal.</p>

<p>In spite of all disadvantages, one of the
greatest being that ships of any size are forced
to lie out far from shore, Tangier is still a place
of some importance as the port of North Morocco.
The description of the town given by Sir Joseph<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
Hooker<a name="Anchor_118" id="Anchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 118.">[118]</a> answers in most particulars to that
written by Teonge two centuries before. It
stands on the western side of a shallow bay, on
rocky ground that rises steeply from the shore,
and the cubical blocks of whitewashed masonry,
with scarcely an opening to represent a window,
which rise one above the other on the steep
slope of a recess in the hills, give the place a
singular appearance from the sea. On the
summit of the hill is a massive gaunt castle of
forbidding aspect, and the zigzag walls which
encompass the city on all sides are pierced by
three gates which are closed at nightfall.</p>

<p class="drop-cap noindent"><span class="upper-case">Pepys</span> desired that his name might
go down to posterity, but he could
little have foreseen the fame that
it has attained in the nineteenth
century. The mode he took to
keep it alive was the bequeathment of his
library and collections to a time-honoured foundation;
and there is every reason to believe
that he would have strongly objected to the
publication of his “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>.” Now that that book
has been published, we all see the full-length
figure of the man; but his character might also
have been read in the Pepysian library at Magdalene
College, Cambridge; and this latter exhibition
of him has been much longer before the
public. Comparatively little interest was, however,
taken in it until after the appearance of
the deciphered “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>,” when his name at once
sprang into fame.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>The library was left, in the first instance, to
the Diarist’s nephew, John Jackson, but with a
special proviso that it should on no account be
dispersed. Pepys refers in his memorandum to
“the infinite pains and time and cost employed
in my collecting and reducing the same to the
state it now is” in. He is particularly solicitous
“for its unalterable preservation and perpetual
security against the ordinary fate of such collections,
falling into the hands of an incompetent
heir and thereby being sold, dissipated or imbezzled.”
Jackson was allowed a certain latitude
in the disposal of the collections after his
death. They were to be placed at one of the
Universities, but Cambridge was to be preferred
to Oxford. A private college was to be chosen
rather than the Public Library, and of colleges
Trinity or Magdalene were to be given the preference
over the others. Of these two colleges
(on the boards of each of which Pepys’s name
had been entered), Magdalene, at which he received
his education, was to have the preference.
The college which did not receive the gift was
appointed visitor, and if at the annual inspection
any breach of covenant occurred, the library became
forfeited to it.</p>

<p>A fair room was to be provided for the library,
and no other books were to be added, save those
which Jackson might add in distinct presses.
The whole was to be called “Bibliotheca Pepysiana,”
and the sole power and custody over it
was to be vested in the master of the college for
the time being.<a name="Anchor_119" id="Anchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 119.">[119]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>
<p>Magdalene College was founded by Lord
Chancellor Audley, who vested for ever the
right of nominating to the mastership in the
possessors of Audley End. At the time that
Pepys was a student the buildings were far from
extensive, and consisted of the first court alone.
The foundation of the second court was laid in
1677, and Pepys’s “Correspondence” contains
a letter from Dr. Hezekiah Burton, asking for
the contribution already promised towards the
new buildings; and another from John Maulyverer
in 1679, thanking for money lent for the
same purpose, and referring to a bond. A fellow-collegian
of Pepys was John Peachell, afterwards
Vicar of Stanwick, Prebendary of Carlisle, and
Master of the College in 1679. He does not
appear to have been altogether an estimable
man, for in 1677 (May 3) Pepys felt half
ashamed to be seen in his company because of
his red nose; and according to Lord Dartmouth’s
manuscript notes on Bishop Burnet’s
“<cite class="plain">History of his own Time</cite>,” there was cause for
this rubicundity, as Archbishop Sancroft rebuked
him for setting an ill example in the
University by drunkenness and other loose behaviour.
Dr. Peachell had his good points,
however, for in 1687 he was suspended from
his mastership and deprived of his vice-chancellorship
for refusing to admit Alban Francis, a
Benedictine monk, to the degree of Master of
Arts without taking the prescribed oaths. It
appears from a letter to Pepys that he greatly
feared the Earl of Suffolk, who was then owner
of Audley End, would be content to have him
removed in order to obtain the privilege of nominating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
a successor, but he was fortunate in
being restored to his office in the following year.</p>

<p>Pepys never forgot a friend, and a month before
this restoration he induced Lord Dartmouth,
on his appointment to the command of the fleet,
to ask Peachell to be his chaplain, with authority
over all the other chaplains. In 1690 the Master
of Magdalene died of starvation brought about
by a four days’ fast which he prescribed himself
as a penance after the archbishop’s admonition;
and when he afterwards tried to eat he could not.</p>

<p>The master at the period of Pepys’s death was
Dr. Quadring, and in the college chest are two
letters written by Jackson to him to inform him
of the will of the deceased respecting the library.
It was not, however, until 1724, on the death of
Jackson, that the three thousand volumes of
which the library consisted were, with the original
bookcases, removed to the college, and
deposited in the new buildings which Pepys had
assisted to build. The old inscription, “Bibliotheca
Pepysiana,” which was set up at the time,
is still to be seen on the front in the second
courtyard.</p>

<p>The library is of the greatest interest, and
a mere enumeration of some of the treasures
contained in it is enough to whet the appetite
of the least ardent among the lovers of old
books. To mention first the manuscripts:&mdash;there
are the various papers collected by Pepys
for his proposed “Navalia;” a “vast treasure of
papers” lent by Evelyn, but never returned to
their owner; seventeen letters from Henry <abbr title="the Eighth">VIII.</abbr>
to Anne Boleyn, copied at Rome from the originals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
in the Vatican, 1682; a collection of papers
relating to Charles <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr>’s escape from Worcester;
a journal of the proceedings of the Duke
of Monmouth in his invading of England,
with the progress and issue of the rebellion
attending it, kept by Mr. Edward Dummer,
then serving the train of artillery employed by
his Majesty for the suppression of the same;
and a Survey (made by order of the Admiralty)
of buildings and encroachments on the River of
Thames, from London Bridge to Cuckold’s
Point, 1684–1687. The Maitland <abbr title="manuscript">MS.</abbr>, which
contains an excellent collection of Scottish
poetry, and is named after Sir Richard Maitland
of Lethington, Lord Privy Seal and Judge
in the Court of Session (b. 1496, d. 1586), who
formed it, is also worthy of special mention. How
the two volumes of which it consists came into
Pepys’s possession is not recorded. Selections
from them were printed by Pinkerton in 1786.</p>

<p>Among the choice articles that should have
some notice, however inadequate, are the pocket-book
constantly used by Sir Francis Drake, and
that of James <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr>, described as follows by Pepys
himself:&mdash;“My Royal master <abbr title="King James the Second">K. James y<span class="super">e</span> 2<span class="super">d</span>.</abbr>
Pocket Book of Rates and Memorandums during
y<span class="super">e</span> whole time of his serving at y<span class="super">e</span> Seas as Lord
High Admiral of England, <abbr title="videlicet">viz<span class="super">t</span>.</abbr>, from May, 1663,
to his laying down his commission, May, 1673.”
Another great curiosity is the original “<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Libro
de Cargos</span> as to Provisions and Munic̃ons of the
Proveedor of the Spanish Armada, 1588,” with
a hole right through, for the purpose of hanging
it up in the ship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>Besides all the papers on naval affairs in the
Pepysian Library, there is a series of fifty
volumes of Pepys’s manuscripts in the Rawlinson
Collection in the Bodleian Library. How
these papers came into the possession of Rawlinson
is not known.</p>

<p>What gives a special interest to the Library
is the fact that it still remains in exactly the
same condition as Pepys left it, the books being
in the original cases, arranged in the order which
he had fixed. There are several entries in the
“<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>” relating to the arrangement and cataloguing
of the books; thus on December 17th,
1666, we read:&mdash;“Spent the evening in fitting
my books, to have the number set upon each,
in order to my having an alphabet of my whole,
which will be of great ease to me.” He employs
his brother John to write out the catalogue
“perfectly alphabeticall,”<a name="Anchor_120" id="Anchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 120.">[120]</a> but he afterwards
finishes it off with his own hand.<a name="Anchor_121" id="Anchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 121.">[121]</a> He was
very particular as to the books he admitted into
his catalogue, so when he bought in the Strand
“an idle rogueish French book, ‘<cite class="plain" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">L’escholle des
filles</cite>,’” he resolved, as soon as he had read it,
to burn it, “that it might not stand in the list of
books nor among them, to disgrace them if it
should be found.”<a name="Anchor_122" id="Anchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 122.">[122]</a> He had, at a later time, a
similar feeling with regard to Lord Rochester’s
poems, and in a letter dated <abbr title="November">Nov.</abbr> 2, 1680, he
directs Hewer to leave the volume in a drawer,
as it is written in a style which he thought
unfitted it for mixing with his other books. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
adds that as the author (who had just died) was
past writing any more poems so bad in one
sense, he despaired of any man surviving “to
write so good in another.”<a name="Anchor_123" id="Anchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 123.">[123]</a> When I was looking
over the Library I made a point of seeing
whether this book had found a place at last on
the shelves, and I discovered it there; but with
sad hypocrisy it stood in false colours, for the
lettering on the back was “Rochester’s Life.”</p>

<p>The books were numbered consecutively
throughout the Library, and, therefore, when re-arranged,
they needed to be all renumbered.
All hands were pressed into this service; and
we read that on the 15th of February, 1667–68,
Pepys himself, his wife, and Deb Willett, were
busy until near midnight “titleing” the books
for the year, and setting them in order. They
all tired their backs, but the work was satisfactory,
though, on the whole, not quite so much so
as the previous year’s job had been.</p>

<p>On account of this constant changing, each
book contains several numbers, sometimes as
many as six; and the last, which is the one by
which the books are still found, is in red ink.</p>

<p>The books are arranged in eleven curious old
mahogany bookcases, which are mentioned in
the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>,” under date August 24th, 1666, and
which gave the Diarist so much pleasure, when
they were sent home quite new by Mr. Sympson,
the joiner and cabinet-maker. The presses
are handsomely carved, and have handles fixed
at each end; the doors are formed of little panes
of glass; and, in the lower divisions, the glass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
windows are made to lift up. The books are all
arranged in double rows; but, by the ingenious
plan of placing small books in front of large
ones, the letterings of all can be seen. Some
have tickets on the outside, and this practice is
mentioned in the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>,” where we read: “To
my chamber, and there to ticket a good part of
my books, in order to the numbering of them
for my easy finding them to read as I have
occasion.”<a name="Anchor_124" id="Anchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 124.">[124]</a></p>

<p>The word “arranged” has been several times
used in this chapter; but it must not be understood
as implying any kind of classification, for
the books are merely placed in order of size.
This arrangement, however, has been very carefully
attended to; and, in one instance, some
short volumes have been raised to the required
height by the help of wooden stilts, gilt in front.</p>

<p>The classification was to be found in the catalogues;
and, as Pepys increased in substance, he
employed experts to do this work for him. One
of these was Paul Lorrain, the author of several
tracts and sermons, who was employed in copying
manuscripts, and making catalogues of books
and prints. A letter from this man, written on
October 12th, 1700, to explain the nature of the
work he then had in hand, is printed in the
correspondence of Pepys.</p>

<p>There are numerous entries in the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>”
relating to the binding of certain books; and a
single glance at the Library as it now exists
would show any one experienced in the matter
that Pepys paid great attention to this most important
point in the proper preservation of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
library. As early as May 15th, 1660, he showed
this taste by buying three books solely on account
of the binding; and on January 18th,
1664–65, he went to his bookseller to give directions
for the new binding of a great many of his
old books, in order that his whole studyful
should be uniform. Nearly all the books are
bound in calf, although some are in morocco and
some in vellum.</p>

<p>Pepys came to the resolution in the year 1667
that he would not have any more books than his
cases would hold; so when, on the 2nd of February,
1667–68, he found that the number of
books had much increased since the previous
year, he was forced to weed out several inferior
ones to make room for better. He had previously
written: “Whereas, before, my delight
was in multitude of books, and spending money
in that, and buying alway of other things, now
that I am become a better husband, and have
left off buying, now my delight is in the neatness
of everything.”<a name="Anchor_125" id="Anchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 125.">[125]</a> This plan he continued to
practise throughout his life, generally to the improvement
of the character of his library, but
not always so.</p>

<p>When I was allowed the privilege of looking
through the Library, I came upon a list of books
headed “Deleta, 1700.” The entries in this list
are most curious. To each title is added a note,
such as these: “Ejected as a duplicate,” “Removed
to a juster place,” “To give way to the
same reprinted,” “To give way to a fairer
edition.”</p>

<p>As the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>” is full of notices of books<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
purchased, I felt interested to know which of
them had been weeded out after they had been
bought, and which had been thought worthy to
remain on to the end.</p>

<p>The following is the result of these inquiries
in a few instances, chosen from the poets:&mdash;On
the 8th of July, 1664, Pepys went to his bookseller
about some books; from his shop he went
on to the binder, to give directions as to the binding
of his “Chaucer;” “and thence to the clasp-makers,
to have it clasped and bossed.” Reposing
in a quiet corner of the Pepysian Library
is Speght’s edition of 1602, which is the identical
copy referred to, and here, therefore, we have
an example of the books that remained. It is
in a plain calf cover, unlettered, “full neat
enough,” with brass clasp and bosses.</p>

<p>This evident attempt to do honour to the
memory of</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="p_line_i10">“That renownmed Poet</div>
    <div class="p_line_i0">Dan Chaucer, well of English undefyled,</div>
    <div class="p_line_i0">On Fame’s eternall beadroll worthie to be fyled,”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">is an incident of the more interest, in that
Chaucer is almost the only great poet that Pepys
was able to appreciate. Sir John Minnes, the
wit, taught him to love England’s grand old
singer. These two men were constantly brought
together in the fulfilment of business duties, and
Pepys writes “among other things Sir J. Minnes
brought many fine expressions of Chaucer, which
he doats on mightily.” To this he adds as his
own opinion, “and without doubt he is a very
fine poet.”<a name="Anchor_126" id="Anchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 126.">[126]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>
<p>That this is not a mere passing remark is
evident, for on August 10th, 1664, he actually
quotes a line from “<cite class="plain">Troilus and Cressida</cite>,” a
most unusual practice with this “matter-of-fact”
man. He goes to visit the famous Cocker, and
has an hour’s talk with him on various matters.
“He (Cocker) says that the best light for his
life to do a very small thing by (contrary to
Chaucer’s words to the Sun, ‘that he should
lend his light to them that small seals grave’)<a name="Anchor_127" id="Anchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 127.">[127]</a> it
should be by an artificial light of a candle, set to
advantage, as he could do it.”</p>

<p>I very much fear that the quotation did not
spring up into Pepys’s own mind, but that it was
suggested by Cocker, who was “a great admirer,
and well read in all our English poets.” More
than thirty years after this, Pepys still remained
one of Chaucer’s warmest admirers, and we have
it on the best authority that we owe Dryden’s
modernization of the “<cite class="plain">Character of a Good
Parson</cite>” to his recommendation.<a name="Anchor_128" id="Anchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 128.">[128]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>
<p>To return, however, to the Pepysian Library.
On the 7th of July, 1664 (the day before he
went to the binder about Chaucer), Pepys
bought “<cite class="plain">Shakespeare’s Plays</cite>.” This probably
was the third edition, which had just appeared;
though it might have been either the first folio
of 1623, or the second folio of 1632; but whichever
of these three it happened to be, it was
replaced in after years by the fourth folio of
1685, which is now in the collection. Although
“<cite class="plain">Paradise Lost</cite>” was first published in 1667,
we find no notice either of it or of its author in
the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>.”</p>

<p>The Library contains the collected edition, in
three folio volumes, of Milton’s Works, published
at London by John Toland in 1698, but
stated in the title-page to be published at Amsterdam.
Pepys probably thought it wise to
have nothing to do with any of the publications
of so dangerous a man as Milton before the
period of the Revolution; and a curious letter
from Daniel Skinner to Pepys, dated from Rotterdam,
November 19th, 1676, shows that a man
might be injured in his public career by the rumour
that he had the works of Milton in his possession.
Skinner agreed with Daniel Elzevir, the last
of that learned race, to print at Amsterdam certain
of Milton’s writings which the poet had left to
him. In the meantime a surreptitious edition of
some State Letters appears, or as Skinner puts
it, “creeps out into the world.” When Sir
Joseph Williamson, the Secretary of State, is
informed of this, and is asked to give a licence
for the proposed authentic edition, he replies
that “he could countenance nothing of that
man’s (Milton) writings.” Upon this, Skinner
gives up his scheme, and lends the papers to
Williamson, but he gets shabby treatment in
return, for on his arrival in Holland he finds
that those likely to employ him have been
warned against him as a dangerous character.<a name="Anchor_129" id="Anchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 129.">[129]</a></p>

<p>The last instance of Pepys’s weeding-out process
shall be “<cite class="plain">Hudibras</cite>,” and it is the most
curious of all. On the 26th of December, 1662,
we read in the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>:” <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>“To the Wardrobe.
Hither come Mr. Battersby; and we falling into
a discourse of a new book of drollery, in verse,
called ‘<cite class="plain">Hudebras</cite>,’ I would needs go find it out,
and met with it at the Temple: cost me <abbr title="2 shillings and sixpence">2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></abbr>
But when I came to read it, it is so silly an
abuse of the Presbyter Knight going to the
warrs, that I am ashamed of it; and by and by
meeting at Mr. Townsend’s at dinner, I sold it
to him for 18<i><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></i>” The book is dated 1663, and
could only have been published a few days when
Pepys bought and sold it at a loss of one shilling.</p>

<p>Warned by his previous experience, he would
not buy the second part when it came out, but
borrowed it “to read, to see if it be as good as
the first, which the world cry so mightily up,
though it hath not a good liking in me, though
I had tried but twice or three times reading to
bring myself to think it witty.”<a name="Anchor_130" id="Anchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 130.">[130]</a></p>

<p>He still remained uneasy, and tried to appreciate
the fashionable poem, so that on December
10th, 1663, he thought it well to buy both parts
and place them in his library. Twenty years
after this he was still doing his best to find
“where the wit lies,” for we find by the “Tangier
Diary” that he read the first two books on
board ship during the voyage out.<a name="Anchor_131" id="Anchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 131.">[131]</a></p>

<p>The edition of “<cite class="plain">Hudibras</cite>” in the Library is
that of 1689, so that the earlier editions must
have been exchanged for it.</p>

<p>It does not say much for the literary taste of
the man who tried in vain to appreciate “<cite class="plain">Hudibras</cite>,”
that he found Cotton’s “Scarronides, or
Virgile Travestie,” “extraordinary good.”<a name="Anchor_132" id="Anchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 132.">[132]</a></p>

<p>The Library contains many very valuable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
volumes; as, for instance, there are nine Caxtons,
and several Wynkyn de Wordes and Pynsons,
but the chief interest centres in the various
collections.</p>

<p>First and foremost among these are the five
folio volumes of old English Ballads, which
contain the largest series of broadside ballads
ever brought together; the next in size being
the well-known Roxburghe Collection, now in
the British Museum.</p>

<p>Pepys has written on the title-page of his
volumes: “Begun by Mr. Selden: Improved
by y<span class="super">e</span> addition of many Pieces elder thereto in
Time, and the whole continued down to the year,
1700, When the Form till then peculiar thereto,
<abbr title="videlicet">viz<span class="super">t</span>.</abbr>, of the Black Letter, with Picturs, seems (for
cheapness sake) wholly laid aside, for that of
the White Letter, without Pictures.”</p>

<p>The Ballads are arranged under the following
heads:&mdash;1. Devotion and Morality. 2. History,
true and fabulous. 3. Tragedy, <abbr title="videlicet">viz.</abbr> murders,
executions, judgements of God. 4. State and
Times. 5. Love, pleasant. 6. Love, unfortunate.
7. Marriage, cuckoldry. 8. Sea: love, gallantry,
and actions. 9. Drinking and good fellowship.
10. Humorous frolics and mirth. The total
number of Ballads is 1800, of which 1376 are in
black letter. Besides these there are four
little duodecimo volumes, lettered as follows:
<abbr title="Volume">Vol.</abbr> 1. Penny Merriments. <abbr title="Volume">Vol.</abbr> 2. Penny Witticisms.
<abbr title="Volume">Vol.</abbr> 3. Penny Compliments; and <abbr title="Volume">Vol.</abbr>
4. Penny Godlinesses.</p>

<p>Other collections are lettered “Old Novels,”
“Loose Plays,” and “Vulgaria.” There are six<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
folio volumes of tracts on the Popish Plot, four
quarto volumes of Sea Tracts, and a collection
of News-Pamphlets for six years, that is, from
January 1st, 1659–60, to January 1st, 1665–66, the
time of the commencement of the Gazettes.
Pepys was the first person to collect prints and
drawings in illustration of London topography.
These he left to his nephew, who added to the
collection, and two thick folio volumes therefore
came to the College with the other treasures.</p>

<p>Pepys’s collections have a special interest,
because he collected his books himself, knew all
about them, and registered them with loving
care. His various catalogues and indexes are
marvels of neatness, and living as he did in a
pre-bibliographical age, he deserves the greatest
credit for the judgment exercised in their production.
In the fifth volume of the little collection
of books on Shorthand, there is an index of
authors, with dates of publication and references
to the volume in which each will be found; and
the following, which is the title of one of the
appendixes to the catalogue, will show how
much labour was willingly expended in the production
of these helps to research: “A chronological
Deductions of the Variations of Stile (to
be collected from y<span class="super">e</span> Alphabet of my books) in
y<span class="super">e</span> language of England between ann. 700 &amp;
y<span class="super">e</span> attempt last made towards its refinement by
Sir Phil<span class="super">p</span> Sidney in his ‘Arcadia,’ between 1580
and 1590.”</p>

<p>Neatness and the love of accuracy were ruling
passions with Pepys, and when a catalogue was
filled up with additional entries he had it re-arranged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
and copied out. On “A Catalogue
and Alphabet to my books of Geography and
Hydrography, 1693–95,” is the following memorandum:
“Before this Index be transcribed far
to collect and alphabet the particulars contained
in the List of additional Books inserted at the
end, and that being done To incorporate both
them and the four particular Indexes preceding
into the Principal, and so as to unite the whole.”</p>

<p>This is an interesting list: “Bibliotheca Nautica,
1695. Catalogue of Authors (the perfectest
I can arrive at) upon the art and practice of
Navigation, with a Chronological Catalogue of
the most eminent Mathematicians of this Nation,
Antient and Modern, to the year 1673.” Some
papers show how all this was arrived at, thus:
“Memorandum, to look over y<span class="super">e</span> Epistles and
Prefaces to all the Bookes in this Collection, of
which I am not maister, and y<span class="super">e</span> other allsoe, and
apply what is usefull through y<span class="super">e</span> whole.” Mr.
Mount, “son-in-law and successor to the late
Mr. Fisher, master of the ancient shopp and our
only magazine of English Books of Navigation
at the Postern on Tower Hill,” prepared a list,
and tried to answer Pepys’s queries. The Diarist
was well known to all the booksellers, and he
doubtless was a good customer, although he
must have troubled them sometimes with his
fastidiousness. A note intended for Mr. Mount
may be looked upon as a good sample of many
more such memorandums, “To get me the ‘Invention
of y<span class="super">e</span> Art of Navigation,’ a fair one for
y<span class="super">e</span> dirty one I bought of him.”</p>

<p>Robert Scott, the famous bookseller of Little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
Britain, when sending Pepys four scarce books,
the total cost of which was only <abbr title="1 pound 14 shillings>"><i>£</i>1 14<i>s.</i></abbr>, writes,
“But without flattery I love to find a rare book
for you.” Herringman, of the “Blue Anchor,”
at the New Exchange in the Strand, Joseph
Kirton, of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Paul’s Churchyard, who was ruined
by the Fire of London, and Bagford, the title-robber,
were some among the booksellers with
whom Pepys had dealings.</p>

<p>Pepys was not a producer of <i>marginalia</i>, but
some of his books contain an occasional note of
interest; thus, in Cotton’s “Compleat Gamester”
(1674), “cocking” is described at page 206 as a
“game of delight and pleasure,” and Pepys added
a manuscript note in the margin, “of barbarity.”
Not only does this give us Pepys’s opinion of
the sport very pithily, but it also illustrates a
passage in the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>,” where he describes his
visit to the cock-fighting in Shoe Lane, and says
he soon had enough of it.<a name="Anchor_133" id="Anchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 133.">[133]</a></p>

<p>All the books in the Library have a bookplate
in the inside cover. These are of different design,
two having Pepys’s portrait (one large and
the other small), and one having S. P. and two
anchors interlaced. Dr. Diamond writes in
“<cite class="plain">Notes and Queries</cite>,” that he once met with a
large quantity of these bookplates in four varieties.
Two were beautifully engraved by Faithorne,
as is supposed, and two were by White.
Some of them had a rough margin, and others
were cut close up to the mantle on the arms.<a name="Anchor_134" id="Anchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 134.">[134]</a></p>

<p>The motto which Pepys adopted, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mens cujusque
is est quisque</i>, was criticized by some of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
Admirals in 1690, and the Diarist desired his
friend Hewer to point out to them, through Mr.
Southerne, that it was a quotation from Cicero’s
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Somnium Scipionis</span>,” and that the thought was
derived from Plato and wrought upon by <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Paul. The whole passage is, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tu vero enitere,
et sic habeto te non esse mortalem, sed Corpus
hoc. Nec enim is est quem forma ista declarat;
sed <i>mens cujusque is est quisque</i>, non ea figura
quæ digito monstrari potest.</span>”</p>

<p>In concluding this notice of the Pepysian
Library, it will be necessary to say a few words
about the Musical collections. Pepys was not a
mere amateur in music, but understood both
theory and practice thoroughly, and he found
consolation from it when troubles came upon
him.<a name="Anchor_135" id="Anchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 135.">[135]</a> On November 2nd, 1661, he tried “to
make a song in praise of a liberal genius,” which
he took his own to be, but the result did not
prove to his mind; and on March 20th, 1668,
he endeavoured to invent “a better theory of
music than hath yet been abroad.”</p>

<p>We have references in the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>” to four
songs which he composed, and a notice of one
which he only attempted.<a name="Anchor_136" id="Anchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 136.">[136]</a> On January 30th,
1659–60, he sang Montrose’s verses on the execution
of Charles <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr> beginning,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="p_line_i0">“Great, good, and just, could I but rate,”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">which he had set to music. He composed
“Gaze not on Swans,” on the 11th of February,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
1661–62; but his grand achievement was the setting
to music of the song,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="p_line_i0">“Beauty retire; thou doest my pitty move,</div>
    <div class="p_line_i0">Believe my pitty, and then trust my love,” <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>,</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">from Davenant’s Second Part of “The Siege of
Rhodes,” (act <abbr title="4">iv.</abbr> <abbr title="scene">sc.</abbr> 2). Mrs. Knipp sang the
song so well that the composer is forced to
exclaim, that it seems to be a very fine song, and
Captain Downing, “who loves and understands
music,” “extols it above everything he had ever
heard.”<a name="Anchor_137" id="Anchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 137.">[137]</a> Further evidence of the pride of the
composer is seen in the fact that he had his portrait
painted with the music of “Beauty retire”
in his hand.</p>

<p>On April 6th, 1666, he began “putting notes”
to Ben Jonson’s song,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="p_line_i0">“It is decreed&mdash;nor shall thy fate, O Rome!</div>
    <div class="p_line_i0">Resist my vow, though hills were set on hills,”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">but he did not finish it until November 11th,
1666. He thought himself that it was even
better than “Beauty retire,” but the opinion of
others is not given.</p>

<p>In the Pepysian Library is a volume of music,
entitled, “Songs and other Compositions, Light,
Grave and Sacred, for a single voice adjusted to
the particular compass of mine; with a thorough
base on y<span class="super">e</span> ghitare, by Cesare Morelli,” which
contains, among others, “Beauty retire,” “It is
decreed,” and “To be or not to be.” We find
in the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>” that on November 13th, 1664,
Pepys was learning to recite this speech of
Hamlet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>In the present day, when few instruments besides
the piano are heard in private houses, it is
somewhat surprising to find how many were
familiar to our ancestors in the seventeenth century,
and a note of some of these will perhaps be
thought interesting.</p>

<p>The lute was a favourite instrument when
Pepys was young, and a good lutenist was in
high esteem among his fellows. Lady Wright’s
butler gave Pepys a lesson or two, and in the
first two years of the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>,” there are several
references to the hours the Diarist spent in practising;
but for a time he was unable to play,
as his lute was in pawn. Various forms of the
violin were much used by Pepys, who rose by
candlelight on the 3rd of December, 1660, and
spent his morning in fiddling, till it was time to
go to the office.</p>

<p>He and Mr. Hill were engaged for an hour
or two in stringing a theorbo; and, on another
occasion, he had it mended at a cost of twenty-six
shillings. The flute and flageolet were always
handy, as he could put them in his pocket,
and use them as occasion required, particularly
if he were in the neighbourhood of an echo. He
mentions the guitar twice in the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>,” but did
not play on it, as he thought it a bauble. He
afterwards altered his opinion, for he expressly
charges Morelli, the arranger of his musical
papers, to set a certain French song to the
guitar; and, as may be seen above, many others
were treated in the same way.<a name="Anchor_138" id="Anchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 138.">[138]</a> He is at one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
time angry with The. Turner because she will
not give him a lesson on the harpsichord; and
afterwards he buys a spinet.<a name="Anchor_139" id="Anchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 139.">[139]</a></p>

<p>I here end the portion of this book which
deals with the life of Pepys himself.</p>

<p>The “Correspondence” discovers a more dignified
character than the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>,” but we cannot
say for certain whether, if we had a diary of the
later years, we should not read such a confession
as this on the 27th of January, 1666–67:&mdash;“Went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
down and sat in a low room (at Sir Philip Warwick’s),
reading ‘Erasmus de scribendis epistolis,’
a very good book, especially one letter
of advice to a courtier, most true and good,
which made me once resolve to tear out the two
leaves that it was writ in, but I forbore it.”</p>

  This is so interesting a fact that I think Dryden’s letter
to Pepys on the subject may well appear in full at this
place:&mdash;</p>

<p class="address_date">“July 14, 1699.</p>
<p>“Padron Mio,</p>
<p class="after_to">
“I remember last year when I had the honour of
dining with you, you were pleased to recommend to me the
character of Chaucer’s “Good Parson.” Any desire of yours
is a command to me, and accordingly I have put it into my
English, with such additions and alterations as I thought fit.
</p>
<p>
“Having translated as many fables from Ovid, and as
many novels from Boccace, and tales from Chaucer, as will
make an indifferent large volume in folio, I intend them for
the press in Michaelmas term next. In the mean time my
Parson desires the favour of being known to you, and promises
if you find any fault in his character, he will reform
it. Whenever you please, he shall wait on you, and for the
safer conveyance, I will carry him in my pocket, who am

“For Samuel Pepys, <abbr title="Esqire">Esq.</abbr>,<br />

</p>

<p>
In Pepys’s answer, dated on the same day, he writes:
“You truly have obliged me, and, possibly, in saying so, I
am more in earnest than you can readily think, as verily
hoping from this your copy of one ‘Good Parson’ to fancy
some amends made me for the hourly offence I bear with
from the sight of so many lewd originals.”&mdash;Smith’s “Life,

<p class="drop-cap noindent"><span class="upper-case">Having</span> concluded that portion of
our subject which relates more
particularly to the personal character
of Pepys, we now pass on to
the general consideration of the
component parts of the world he lived in. As
Pepys was a thorough Londoner, and as most of
the circumstances related in the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>” refer to
London, I propose to commence with a notice
of some parts of the capital at the time of the
Restoration.</p>

<p>The almost constant use of the River as a
highway is a marked feature of the habits of the
time, which is illustrated by the fact that Pepys
makes a point of mentioning that he went to a
place “by land,” when from some cause or other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
he did not take a boat; thus, on March 8th,
1659–60, we read, “Home about two o’clock,
and took my wife <em>by land</em> to Paternoster Row,
to buy some paragon for a petticoat, and so home
again.” When Pepys was appointed Clerk of
the Acts, and he was settled in his house in
Seething Lane, he found that a constant communication
was necessary between the Navy
Office in the City, and the Admiralty at Whitehall.
In his frequent journeys by boat from
place to place, he often stopped at Blackfriars, in
order to visit Lord Sandwich at the “Wardrobe,”
where the royal clothes were kept. Sometimes,
when there were shows and pageants on the
Thames, it was no easy matter to get a boat, and on
the occasion of the Queen’s coming to town from
Hampton Court, when her barge was attended
by ten thousand barges and boats, Pepys in vain
tempted the watermen with a bribe of eight shillings.<a name="Anchor_140" id="Anchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 140.">[140]</a>
One of the chief dangers of boat traffic
was found in “shooting” London Bridge, and it
was generally considered good policy to get out
of the boat and pass from side to side on foot
instead of going through the arches. One Sunday
night,<a name="Anchor_141" id="Anchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 141.">[141]</a> however, our Diarist passed through
the “rapids,” and did not like the sensation he
experienced. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>“And so to Whitehall to Sir G.
Carteret, and so to the Chappell, where I challenged
my pew as Clerke of the Privy Seale, and
had it, and then walked home with Mr. Blagrave,
to his old house in the Fishyard, and there he
had a pretty kinswoman that sings, and we did
sing some holy things, and afterwards others
came in, and so I left them, and by water through
the bridge (which did trouble me) home, and so
to bed.” It was not, however, much safer on
the bridge than under it, for on one occasion
Pepys nearly broke his leg there. He had been
in Southwark, spending the evening at the well-known
inn, the “Bear at the bridge foot,” and
when he wished to get home he could not find
his coach, so he was forced to go over the bridge
through the darkness and the dirt. His leg fell
into a hole, although there was a constable
standing by to warn persons away from the
dangerous spot. At first he thought his leg
was broken, but when he was pulled up he was
found not to be much hurt.<a name="Anchor_142" id="Anchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 142.">[142]</a></p>

<p>One of the advantages which our forefathers
possessed over us, was to be found in the nearness
of the fields and country lanes to their
offices and shops. Pepys often indulged himself
in a walk or a romp over the grass, in places
that are now covered with bricks. On July 29th,
1669, he writes: “I dined, and in the afternoon,
with Dick Vines and his brother Payton, we
walked to Lisson-greene and Marybone and
back again.” On October 9th, 1660, he says, “I
met with Sir W. Pen again, and so with him
to Redriffe by water, and from thence walked
over the fields to Deptford, the first pleasant
walk I have had a great while.” One Sunday
he goes to Clerkenwell Church, and walks home
across the fields.<a name="Anchor_143" id="Anchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 143.">[143]</a> At another time he takes the
air in the fields beyond <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Pancras.<a name="Anchor_144" id="Anchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 144.">[144]</a> There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
is, however, another side to this pleasing picture;
for these places were not always safe, and the
pleasure-seekers were sometimes alarmed. One
day Pepys and a friend were walking from
Chelsea into town, when they were joined by
a companion, and we read that, “coming among
some trees near the Neate houses he began to
whistle, which did give us some suspicion, but
it proved that he that answered him was Mr.
Marsh (the Lutenist) and his wife, and so we
all walked to Westminster together.”<a name="Anchor_145" id="Anchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 145.">[145]</a> In the
following year Pepys walked from Woolwich to
Rotherhithe on a fine moonshiny night, but he
was accompanied by three or four armed men.<a name="Anchor_146" id="Anchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 146.">[146]</a>
It gave him much satisfaction to be thought of
enough importance to have such an escort provided
for him unasked.</p>

<p>So much for the country parts near the town,
but the streets appear to have been even less
safe after dark. Those who wanted to find
their way had to carry links,<a name="Anchor_147" id="Anchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 147.">[147]</a> as those without
them fared but badly. The gates of the City
were shut at night, but this had the effect of
shutting in some of the ill-disposed as well as
in shutting out others. Pepys and his party on
coming home one night from the play found
the gates closed. He goes on to say in the
“<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>,” <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>“At Newgate we find them in trouble,
some thieves having this night broke open
prison. So we through and home; and our
coachman was fain to drive hard from two
or three fellows which he said were rogues
that he met at the end of Blowbladder
Street.”<a name="Anchor_148" id="Anchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 148.">[148]</a></p>

<p>A London mob has never been famed for politeness,
and we do not gain a very pleasing view of
those in Pepys’s day from some of the entries in
the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>.” On the 27th of November, 1662,
the Russian Ambassador entered the city, and
the trained bands, the King’s Life Guards, and
wealthy citizens clad in black velvet coats with
gold chains were ready to receive him. Pepys did
not see the Ambassador in his coach, but he was
pleased with the “attendants in their habits and
fur caps, very handsome, comely men, and most
of them with hawks upon their fists to present
to the King.” He adds, however, “But, Lord!
to see the absurd nature of Englishmen, that
cannot forbear laughing and jeering at everything
that looks strange.”</p>

<p>The high road of Newgate Street was
formerly crowded in a most inconvenient degree
by the shambles of the butchers, and our Diarist
once got into trouble while driving past them.
The account of this adventure is amusing, from
the ease with which he got out of his difficulty.
“My coach plucked down two pieces of beef
into the dirt, upon which the butchers stopped
the horses, and a great rout of people in the
street, crying that he had done him 40<i>s.</i> and <abbr title="5 pounds"><i>£</i>5</abbr>
worth of hurt; but going down I saw that he
had little or none; and so I give them a shilling
for it, and they were well contented.”<a name="Anchor_149" id="Anchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 149.">[149]</a></p>

<p>The following is a good sample of the quarrels
that were constantly occurring; there being no
authority to put a stop to such exhibitions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
“Great discourse of the fray yesterday in
Moorfields; how the butchers at first did beat
the weavers (between whom there hath been
ever an old competition for mastery), but at last
the weavers rallied and beat them. At first the
butchers knocked down all for weavers that had
green or blue aprons, till they were fain to pull
them off and put them in their breeches. At last
the butchers were fain to pull off their sleeves,
that they might not be known, and were soundly
beaten out of the field, and some deeply wounded
and bruised; till at last the weavers went out
triumphing, calling <abbr title="100 pounds"><i>£</i>100</abbr> for a butcher.”<a name="Anchor_150" id="Anchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 150.">[150]</a> Moorfields,
now occupied by Finsbury Square and
Circus and the surrounding streets, was at this
time one of the chief recreation grounds outside
the City walls. It was partly given up to the
laundresses and bleachers; and boxers and cudgel-players
found in it a congenial sphere for their
amusements. On an emergency, the troops
were mustered on the fenny ground.</p>

<p>None of Pepys’s days passed without a visit to
some tavern, for a morning draught, or a pint of
wine after dinner. The notice of these little
jovialities has preserved to us the names of
several old inns, such as the Star, Half Moon,
Harp and Ball, Swan, Bull Head, Plough, Lion,
Cock, Greyhound, Globe, Mitre, Cardinal’s Cap,
King’s Head, Hercules Pillars, Trumpet, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>
We read in the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>,” that on March 6th,
1659–60, there was a friendly meeting at one of
these places: <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>“While we were drinking, in comes
Mr. Day, a carpenter in Westminster, to tell me
that it was Shrove tuesday, and that I must go
with him to their yearly club upon this day, which,
I confess, I had quite forgot. So I went to the
Bell, where were Mr. Eglin, Veezy, Vincent, a
butcher, one more, and Mr. Tanner, with whom
I played upon a viall and viallin, after dinner,
and were very merry, with a special good dinner,
a leg of veal and bacon, two capons and fritters,
with abundance of wine.” On January 10th,
1659–60, Pepys “drank a pint of wine at the
Star, in Cheapside,” and on May 24th, 1662, he
took his “morning draft” at the same house.
These entries show how rapidly our forefathers
went from place to place, and how little they
thought of the distance between the City and
Westminster; this facility being evidently caused
by the water carriage. On a certain day Pepys
starts from Axe Yard, drinks his morning draught
with a friend, at the Sun, in Chancery Lane, and
then goes to Westminster Hall. At noon he visits
the Swan, in Fish Street; then goes back to
Westminster, looking in at the Coffee Club and
the Hall before going home.<a name="Anchor_151" id="Anchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 151.">[151]</a> The Swan, in Old
Fish Street, is mentioned in an inquisition held
before the mayor and aldermen in 1413, as
“The Swan on the Hoop.” The house was destroyed
in the Great Fire, but was rebuilt and
advertised to be let in the “<cite class="plain">Spectator</cite>” of April
25th, 1712.</p>

<p>King Street, Westminster, was full of inns.
Pepys’s favourite haunt was the Leg, where an
ordinary was held. On December 6th, 1660, he
and Mr. Moore went there, and “dined together
on a neat’s tongue and udder.” Again, on April<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
6th, 1661, “with Mr. Creed and More to the
Leg, in the Palace, to dinner, which I gave them,
and after dinner I saw the girl of the house,
being very pretty, go into a chamber, and I
went in after her and kissed her.” Two other
King Street taverns were visited by Pepys, in
July and August, 1660&mdash;<abbr title="videlicet">viz.</abbr>, the Sun and the
Dog. These houses of entertainment are both
noted as haunts of Ben Jonson, in Herrick’s
Address to the Shade of “Glorious Ben.”</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Another Sun, that behind the Exchange, was a
famous house frequented by Pepys; it was rebuilt
after the Fire by John Wadlow, the host
of the Devil Tavern, and son of the more famous
Simon Wadlow whom Ben Jonson dubbed
“Old Sym, the King of Skinkers.” Pepys
often went with his colleagues to the Dolphin,
and drank “a great quantity of sack” there.
On April 25th, 1661, he “went to an ordinary
at the King’s Head, in Tower Street, and there
had a dirty dinner.” On June 21st, of the same
year, we read, “This morning, going to my
father’s, I met him, and so he and I went and
drank our morning draft at the Samson, in Paul’s
Churchyard.” On October 9th, he went after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
the theatre “to the Fleece tavern, in Covent
Garden, where Luellin, and Blurton, and my old
friend, Frank Bagge, was to meet me, and there
staid till late, very merry.” This was the chief
tavern in Covent Garden, but being the resort
of bullies, it obtained a very unenviable notoriety.
The Green Dragon, on Lambeth Hill, the
Golden Lion, near Charing Cross, the Old Three
Tuns at the same place, and the Pope’s Head,
in Chancery Lane, are among the other taverns
mentioned by Pepys. The Rhenish Wine-house,
in the Steelyard, Upper Thames Street, was a
favourite resort, and is frequently mentioned by
the old dramatists. Pepys went there sometimes,
but he more often visited another house
so called in Cannon Row. All kinds of drinks
were alike agreeable to our Diarist, and he did
not even disdain “mum,” a strong beer brewed
from wheat, which was once popular and sold
at special mum-houses.</p>

<p>These constant visits to taverns were not
very conducive to temperate habits of life, and
we therefore read much of the midday revellings
of the business men. One day, Pepys being a
little more sober than Sir W. Penn, has to lead
that worthy knight home through the streets,
and on another occasion he resolves not to drink
any more wine,&mdash;a rash vow which he forthwith
breaks. Sometimes with amusing casuistry he
tries to keep his vow to the letter while he breaks
it in the spirit; thus, to allude again to the
characteristic entry, on October 29th, 1663, we
read, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>“Went into the Buttery, and there stayed
and talked, and then into the Hall again; and
there wine was offered, and they drunk, I only
drinking some hypocras,<a name="Anchor_152" id="Anchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 152.">[152]</a> which do not break my
vow, it being, to the best of my present judgement,
only a mixed compound drink, and not
any wine. If I am mistaken, God forgive me!
but I hope and do think I am not.”</p>

<p>We have seen Pepys dividing his time pretty
equally between the City and Westminster, and
doing official work in both places. In Westminster
Hall he was on friendly terms with all the
shopkeepers who formerly kept their little stalls
in that place, and most of the watermen at the
different stairs, who recognized his genial face,
were emulous of the honour of carrying him as
a fare. There is an entry in the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>” which
records a curious custom amongst the stationers
of the Hall. Pepys went on January 30th,
1659–60, to “Westminster Hall, where Mrs.
Lane and the rest of the maids had their white
scarfs, all having been at the burial of a young
bookseller.”</p>

<p>Two of the most important events in the history
of Old London,&mdash;<abbr title="videlicet">viz.</abbr>, the Plague and the
Fire,&mdash;are very fully described in the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>.”</p>

<p>On the 7th of June, 1665, Pepys for the first
time saw two or three houses marked with the
red cross, and the words “Lord have mercy
upon us” on the doors; and the sight made him
feel so ill at ease that he was forced to buy some
roll tobacco to smell and chew. Then we read
of the rapid increase in the numbers of those
struck down; of those buried in the open Tuttle-fields<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
at Westminster; and of the unfriendly
feelings that were engendered by fear.</p>

<p>Pepys remained either in town or in its neighbourhood
during the whole time of the raging of
the pestilence; and on the 4th of September,
1665, he wrote an interesting letter to Lady
Carteret, from Woolwich, in which he said:
“The absence of the court and emptiness of
the city takes away all occasion of news, save
only such melancholy stories as would rather
sadden than find your ladyship any divertissement
in the hearing. I have stayed in the city
till above 7,400 died in one week, and of them
above 6,000 of the plague, and little noise heard
day or night but tolling of bells; till I could
walk Lumber Street and not meet twenty persons
from one end to the other, and not fifty
upon the Exchange; till whole families, ten and
twelve together, have been swept away; till my
very physician, Dr. Burnet, who undertook to
secure me against any infection, having survived
the month of his own house being shut up, died
himself of the plague; till the nights, though
much lengthened, are grown too short to conceal
the burials of those that died the day before,
people being thereby constrained to borrow daylight
for that service; lastly, till I could find
neither meat nor drink safe, the butcheries being
everywhere visited, my brewer’s house shut up,
and my baker, with his whole family, dead of the
plague.”</p>

<p>He then relates a romantic incident which
had just occurred, and a note of which he also
inserted in his “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>:” <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>“Greenwich begins
apace to be sickly; but we are, by the command
of the king, taking all the care we can to prevent
its growth; and meeting to that purpose
yesterday, after sermon with the town officers,
many doleful informations were brought us, and,
among others, this, which I shall trouble your
ladyship with the telling. Complaint was brought
us against one in the town for receiving into his
house a child brought from an infected house in
London. Upon inquiry, we found that it was
the child of a very able citizen in Gracious
Street, who, having lost already all the rest of
his children, and himself and wife being shut up,
and in despair of escaping, implored only the
liberty of using the means for the saving of this
only babe, which, with difficulty, was allowed,
and they suffered to deliver it, stripped naked,
out at a window, into the arms of a friend, who,
shifting into fresh cloathes, conveyed it thus
to Greenwich, where, upon this information from
Alderman Hooker, we suffer it to remain.”</p>

<p>On the 20th of this same month of September
we read in the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>:” “But, Lord! what a
sad time it is to see no boats upon the River,
and grass grows all up and down White Hall
court, and nobody but poor wretches in the
streets.” And on October 16th, Pepys is told
that, in Westminster, “there is never a physician,
and but one apothecary left,&mdash;all being
dead.”</p>

<p>In the following January, the question of attending
to the overcrowded churchyards had
begun to agitate the public mind; and those
who lived in their immediate neighbourhood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
were anxious that they should be covered with
lime.<a name="Anchor_153" id="Anchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 153.">[153]</a> Not many months after this the greater
portion of the city had become a void.</p>

<p>On the 2nd of September, 1666, Pepys was
called up at three o’clock to see a fire; but not
thinking much of it, he went to bed again. When,
however, he got up, he found that about 300
houses had been burnt in the night. All were
now busy in moving their property from place to
place; and the women worked as hard as the
men in doing what was needed. Some almost
incredible instances of meanness are recorded in
the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>,” respecting those rich men who gave
shillings grudgingly to those who saved their
all. Alderman Starling, whose house was saved
by the Navy Office men, while the next house
was burning, gave <abbr title="2 shillings and sixpence">2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></abbr> to be divided among
thirty of them, and then quarrelled with some
that would remove the rubbish out of the way of
the fire, on the score that they came to steal.
Sir William Coventry told Pepys of another
case which occurred in Holborn. An offer was
made to one whose house was in great danger,
to stop the fire for a sum that came to about
<abbr title="2 shillings and sixpence">2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></abbr> a man, but he would only give <abbr title="1 shilling and sixpence">1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></abbr><a name="Anchor_154" id="Anchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 154.">[154]</a></p>

<p>Clothworkers’ Hall burnt for three days and
nights, on account of the oil in the cellars; and
so intense was the heat caused by extension of
the fire over a large space, that the ground
of the City continued to smoke even in
December.<a name="Anchor_155" id="Anchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 155.">[155]</a></p>

<p>Moorfields was the chief resort of the houseless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
Londoners, and soon paved streets and two-storey
houses were seen in that swampy place,
the City having let the land on leases of seven
years.</p>

<p>It was said that this national disaster had
been foretold, and the prophecies of Nostrodamus
and Mother Shipton were referred to.</p>

<p>Sir Roger L’Estrange, the Licenser of Almanacs,
told Sir Edward Walker that most of those
that came under his notice foretold the fire, but
that he had struck the prophecy out.<a name="Anchor_156" id="Anchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 156.">[156]</a> Lady
Carteret told Pepys a curious little fact, which
was, that abundance of pieces of burnt papers
were driven by the wind as far as Cranborne, in
Windsor Forest; “and, among others, she took
up one, or had one brought her to see, which
was a little bit of paper that had been printed,
whereon there remained no more nor less than
these words: ‘Time is, it is done.’”<a name="Anchor_157" id="Anchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 157.">[157]</a></p>

<p>It is well known that the unfortunate Roman
Catholics were charged with the crime of having
set London on fire, and there appears to have
been a very sufficient reason why the people
should persist in affirming this fable. The judges
determined, in the case of disputed liability
between landlord and tenant, that the tenants
should bear the loss in all casualties of fire
arising in their own houses or in those of
their neighbours; but if the fire was caused by
an enemy they were not liable. As one poor
man was convicted and hanged for the crime, it
was held that the landlords must be mulcted.<a name="Anchor_158" id="Anchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 158.">[158]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
Public opinion shifted about in this matter, for
we read that on September 16th, 1667, Pepys
saw “a printed account of the examinations
taken, touching the burning ... showing
the plot of the Papists therein, which it seems
hath been ordered to be burnt by the hands of
the hangman, in Westminster Palace.”<a name="Anchor_159" id="Anchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 159.">[159]</a></p>

<p>London remained in ruins for many months,
and as late as April 23rd, 1668, Pepys describes
himself as wearily walking round the walls in
order to escape the dangers within. At last
new streets of houses arose from the ruins, but,
unfortunately, in spite of the proposals of Wren,
Hooke, and Evelyn for erecting a handsome
and well-arranged city, the old lines were in
almost every case retained.</p>

<p>A passage in the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>” in which Pepys
remarks on the great streets “marked out with
piles drove in the ground,” and expresses the
opinion that, if ever so built, they will form “a
noble sight,” would seem to show that at one
time a better plan of building was contemplated.<a name="Anchor_160" id="Anchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 160.">[160]</a></p>

<p>Had the plan suggested in Parliament by
Colonel Birch been carried out, great difficulties
would have been avoided. His proposal was,
that the whole ground should be sold and placed
in trust. Then the trustees were to sell again,
with preference to the former owners, by which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
means a general plan of building might have
been adopted; but an unequalled opportunity
of making London into a fine city was let slip.<a name="Anchor_161" id="Anchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 161.">[161]</a></p>

<p>At one time it was supposed that the Fire
would cause a westward march of trade, but the
City asserted the old supremacy when it was
rebuilt.</p>

<p>Soon after the conclusion of the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>,”
Pepys left the Navy Office, and the latter years
of his life were spent partly in York Buildings
and partly at Clapham. It was after the Restoration
that the West End grew into importance,
and the house at the foot of Buckingham Street,
from the windows of which Pepys could look
out upon the river, was not built when the
Diarist was settled in Crutched Friars. It was
erected upon part of the site of York House,
whose last resident was the worthless Buckingham:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="p_line_i0">“<abbr title="Beggared">Beggar’d</abbr> by fools, whom still he found too late,</div>
    <div class="p_line_i0">He had his jest, and they had his estate.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>This house, in which Pepys was pleased to
find “the remains of the noble soul of the late
Duke of Buckingham appearing, in the door-cases
and the windows,”<a name="Anchor_162" id="Anchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 162.">[162]</a> was sold by his son
and demolished in 1672.</p>

<p>As Pepys left London so it remained in its
chief features for more than one hundred years,
and it was not until the beginning of the present
century that the vast extension of the town to
the north and south began to make itself felt.</p>

<p class="chapter_name">PEPYS’S RELATIONS, FRIENDS, AND
ACQUAINTANCES.</p>

<p class="chapter_quote">“If a man does not make new acquaintances as he advances
through life he will soon find himself left alone; a
man should keep his friendship in constant repair.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dr.
Johnson.</span></p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap noindent"><span class="upper-case">Family</span> feeling was strong in
Pepys, and we therefore find him
in constant communication with
persons in all degrees of relationship.
These relations varied
greatly in social position, from the peer to the
little shopkeeper. Thus we find that one Pepys
was a Lord Chief Justice of Ireland; another a
Member of Parliament; another a Doctor of
Divinity; another a goldsmith, and another a
turner.</p>

<p>In later life, when Pepys had risen greatly in
social importance, the relations were not so
much associated with, and a more distinguished
circle of friends make their appearance. This
gradual dropping away of the relations may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
have been caused by decrease of the family, for
the Diarist on one occasion writes: “It is a sad
consideration how the Pepys’s decay, and nobody
almost that I know in a present way of
increasing them.”<a name="Anchor_163" id="Anchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 163.">[163]</a></p>

<p>The members of Pepys’s immediate family
have already been alluded to, and we have seen
how his father, John Pepys, the tailor, retired to
Brampton in 1661. The old man died in 1680,
and desired by his will that all the lands and
goods left him by his brother Robert should be
delivered up to his eldest son. He also left <abbr title="5 pounds"><i>£</i>5</abbr>
to the poor of Brampton, and 40<i><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></i> to the poor
of Ellington, and the remainder of his property
to be divided amongst his three children&mdash;Samuel
and John and Paulina Jackson. John,
however, died before him.</p>

<p>Of the numerous cousins who figure in the
“<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>,” the Turners and the Joyces are the most
frequently referred to. Serjeant John Turner
and his wife Jane, who lived in Salisbury Court,
were not very highly esteemed by Sir William
Baker, who called the one a false fellow and the
other a false woman, and Pepys does not appear
altogether to have disliked hearing him say so.<a name="Anchor_164" id="Anchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 164.">[164]</a></p>

<p>Their daughter Theophila was, however, a
favourite with Pepys, and on March 3, 1662–63,
she showed him his name on her breast as her
valentine, “which,” he observes, “will cost me
20<i><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></i>” Four days afterwards he bought her a
dozen pairs of white gloves.</p>

<p>The Joyces were never much liked by Pepys,
but at one time he thought it well to be friends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
with them, as he writes on the 6th of August,
1663,&mdash;“I think it convenient to keep in with
the Joyces against a bad day, if I should have
occasion to make use of them.” William Joyce
was good-natured, but Pepys wearied of his
company because he was “an impertinent coxcomb”
and too great a talker. As is often the
case with our Diarist, he gives a different character
of the man on another occasion. He
writes, “A cunning, crafty fellow he is, and dangerous
to displease, for his tongue spares nobody.”<a name="Anchor_165" id="Anchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 165.">[165]</a></p>

<p>Anthony Joyce was in business, and on one
occasion he supplied Pepys with some tallow,
payment for which he was unduly anxious about,
so that the purchaser was vexed.<a name="Anchor_166" id="Anchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 166.">[166]</a> Anthony
gave over trade in 1664, but was ruined by the
Fire; and afterwards kept the “Three Stags” at
Holborn Conduit. William was greatly disgusted
when his brother became a publican.
Pepys says he ranted about it “like a prince,
calling him hosteller and his sister hostess.”<a name="Anchor_167" id="Anchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 167.">[167]</a></p>

<p>In January, 1667–68, Anthony threw himself
into a pond at Islington, but being seen by a
poor woman, he was got out before life was extinct.
“He confessed his doing the thing, being
led by the devil; and do declare his reason to be,
his trouble in having forgot to serve God as he
ought since he came to this new employment.”<a name="Anchor_168" id="Anchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 168.">[168]</a>
He died soon after this, and his friends were in
great fear that his goods would be seized upon
on the ground that he was a suicide. Pepys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
used all his influence to save the estate, and obtained
the King’s promise that it should not be
taken from the widow and children. Those
who were likely to benefit by the confiscation
gave much trouble, and managed to stop the
coroner’s verdict for a time. At last, however,
the widow’s friends on the jury saved her from
further anxiety by giving a verdict that her husband
died of a fever. “Some opposition there
was, the foreman pressing them to declare the
cause of the fever, thinking thereby to obstruct
it; but they did adhere to their verdict, and
would give no reason.”<a name="Anchor_169" id="Anchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 169.">[169]</a></p>

<p>Kate Joyce (Anthony’s widow) was a pretty
woman, and caused Pepys some trouble. She
had many offers of marriage, and after a short
period of widowhood she married one Hollingshed,
a tobacconist.<a name="Anchor_170" id="Anchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 170.">[170]</a> Pepys was disgusted, and
left her to her own devices with the expression,
“As she brews let her bake.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Kite, the butcher, was another of Pepys’s
aunts whose company he did not greatly appreciate.
He was, however, her executor, and at
her death he calls her daughter ugly names,
thus: “Back again with Peg Kite, who will be
I doubt a troublesome carrion to us executors.”<a name="Anchor_171" id="Anchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 171.">[171]</a>
A few days after she is called “a slut,”<a name="Anchor_172" id="Anchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 172.">[172]</a> and
when she declares her firm intention to marry
“the beggarly rogue the weaver,” the executors
are “resolved neither to meddle nor make with
her.”<a name="Anchor_173" id="Anchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 173.">[173]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>Few of these family connections were left
when Pepys himself died, for in the long list of
persons to whom rings and mourning were given
the following relations only are noticed:&mdash;Samuel
and John Jackson, sons of Pall Jackson (born
Pepys), the two nephews; Balthazar <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michel</span>,
brother-in-law, and his daughter Mary; Roger
Pepys, of Impington, Edward Pickering, Tim
Turner, the minister of Tooting; Mr. Bellamy,
Mr. and Mrs. Mathews, Dr. Montagu, Dean of
Durham; and the Earl of Sandwich.</p>

<p>Dr. Daniel Milles, the minister of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Olave’s,
Hart Street, was one of Pepys’s life-long acquaintances&mdash;we
can hardly call him friend, for
the Diarist never seems to have cared much for
him. We read how he “nibbled at the Common
Prayer,” then how he took to the surplice, and
gradually changed from the minister under the
Commonwealth to the Church of England rector
under Charles. A year or two after he ought to
have been accustomed to the Prayer-Book, he
made an extraordinary blunder in reading the
service. Instead of saying, “We beseech Thee
to preserve to our use the kindly fruits of the
earth,” he said: “Preserve to our use our gracious
Queen Katherine.”<a name="Anchor_174" id="Anchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 174.">[174]</a> In 1667 he was presented
to the rectory of Wanstead, in Essex,
and in order to qualify him for holding two
livings at the same time, he was made one of
the Duke of York’s chaplains.<a name="Anchor_175" id="Anchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 175.">[175]</a></p>

<p>It is often amusing to notice how frequently
Pepys changed his opinion of certain persons:
for instance, in 1660, he calls Mr. Milles <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>“a very
good minister,”<a name="Anchor_176" id="Anchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 176.">[176]</a> while in 1667 he styles him “a
lazy fat priest.”<a name="Anchor_177" id="Anchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 177.">[177]</a></p>

<p>Two men who occupy a considerable space in
the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>” are the two clerks, Thomas Hayter
and William Hewer. Most of those who were
in anyway connected with Pepys were helped on
by him in the struggle of life, and his clerks were
no exception to this rule. Hayter was appointed
Clerk of the Acts in 1674, and Secretary of the
Admiralty in 1679; and subsequently Hewer was
a Commissioner of the Navy and Treasurer for
Tangier. Some of those whose fortunes had
been made by Pepys turned out ungrateful when
their patron was out of power; but Hewer continued
to be a comfort to the old man to the last.</p>

<p>Allusion has already been made to Pepys’s
helpers in the arrangement of his books and
papers, and therefore much need not be said
about them here. While the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>” was
being written, Pepys obtained help from his wife
and brother-in-law and servants; but when he
became more opulent he employed educated
men to write for him. One of these was Cesare
Morelli, an Italian, recommended by Thomas
Hill. He arranged Pepys’s musical papers, and
in 1681 he acknowledged the receipt of <abbr title="7 pounds"><i>£</i>7</abbr>,
which made a total of <abbr title="85 pounds 17 shillings and sixpence"><i>£</i>85 17<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></abbr> received
from Pepys during a period extending from
November 4th, 1678, to August 13th, 1681.<a name="Anchor_178" id="Anchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 178.">[178]</a>
This friendship, which does Pepys much credit,
caused him some trouble, as Morelli was a Roman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
Catholic, and the zealots falsely affirmed
that he was also a priest.</p>

<p>Pepys early made the acquaintance of Dr.
Petty, who was a member of the Rota Club; and
he frequently mentions him and his double-bottomed
boat (named “The Experiment”) in
the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>.” Many anecdotes are told of Petty
by Aubrey&mdash;how he was poor at Paris, and lived
for a week on three pennyworth of walnuts;
how, while teaching anatomy at Oxford, he revived
Nan Green after her execution, and how
he obtained the Professorship of Music at Gresham
College by the interest of Captain John
Graunt, author of “Observations on the Bills
of Mortality.” At the Restoration Petty was
knighted, and made Surveyor-General of Ireland,
where he gathered a large fortune. Pepys
considered Sir William Petty to be one of the
most rational men that he ever heard speak with
tongue;<a name="Anchor_179" id="Anchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 179.">[179]</a> and he was also an excellent droll.
The latter character was proved when a soldier
knight challenged him to fight. He was very
short-sighted; and, having the privilege of nominating
place and weapon for the duel, he chose
a dark cellar for the place, and a great carpenter’s
axe for the weapon. This turned the challenge
into ridicule, and the duel never came off.</p>

<p>Petty was a prominent Fellow of the Royal
Society, and about 1665 he presented a paper
on “The Building of Ships,” which the President
(Lord Brouncker) took away and kept to
himself, according to Aubrey, with the remark,
that <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>“’twas too great an arcanum of State to be
commonly perused.” Aubrey also relates an excellent
story <i>apropos</i> of the Royal Society’s anniversary
meeting on <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Andrew’s Day. The
relater had remarked that he thought it was not
well the Society should have pitched upon the
patron of Scotland’s day, as they should have
taken <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> George or <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Isidore (a philosopher
canonized). “No,” said Petty, “I would rather
have had it on <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Thomas’s Day, for he
would not believe till he had seen and put his
fingers into the holes, according to the motto,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nullius in verba</i>.”</p>

<p>Among the City friends of Pepys, the Houblons
stand forward very prominently. James
Houblon, the father, died in 1682, in his ninetieth
year, and was buried in the church of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mary
Woolnoth, his epitaph being written in Latin by
Pepys. His five sons are frequently mentioned
in the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>,” but James and Wynne were
more particularly his friends, and were among
those who received mourning rings after his
death. In 1690, when Pepys was committed to
the Gate-house, and four gentlemen came forward
to bail him, James Houblon was one of
these four.<a name="Anchor_180" id="Anchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 180.">[180]</a></p>

<p>Alderman Backwell, the chief goldsmith of his
time, had many dealings with Pepys, who went
to him at one time to change some Dutch money,
and at another to weigh Lord Sandwich’s crusados.<a name="Anchor_181" id="Anchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 181.">[181]</a>
Probably our Diarist was rather troublesome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
at times, for once he bought a pair of candlesticks,
which soon afterwards he changed for a
cup, and at last he obtained a tankard in place
of the cup. In 1665 there was a false report
that Backwell was likely to become a bankrupt;
but in 1672, on the closing of the Exchequer, the
King owed him <abbr title="293,994 pounds 16 shillings and sixpence"><i>£</i>293,994 16<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></abbr>, and he was in
consequence ruined by Charles’s dishonest action.
On his failure many of his customers’ accounts
were taken over by the predecessors of the
present firm of Child and Co., the bankers.</p>

<p>We shall have occasion to allude in the <a href="#Ref_Chapter_VIII" title="Go to reference">next
chapter</a> to some of those who were brought in
contact with Pepys in the way of business; but
it is necessary to say a few words here about two
men who were both official acquaintances and
personal friends. Sir Anthony Deane was one of
the most accomplished shipbuilders of his time,
and a valuable public servant, but he did not
escape persecution. A joint charge of betraying
the secrets of the British navy was made against
Pepys and Deane in 1675. In 1668 Deane had
held the office of shipwright at Portsmouth, and
afterwards he was appointed a Commissioner of
the Navy. In 1680 he resigned his post, but in
1681 he again formed one of the new Board
appointed by James <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr>, and hoped to help in
improving the condition of the navy, which was
then in a very reduced state. After the Revolution
he sought retirement in Worcestershire,
and the two old men corresponded and compared
notes on their states of mind. Deane
wrote to Pepys: <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>“These are only to let you
know I am alive. I have nothing to do but read,
walk and prepare for all chances, attending this
obliging world. I have the old soldier’s request,
a little space between business and the grave,
which is very pleasant on many considerations.
As most men towards their latter end grow
serious, so do I in assuring you that I am,” <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr><a name="Anchor_182" id="Anchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 182.">[182]</a>
Pepys replied: “I am alive too, I thank God!
and as serious, I fancy, as you can be, and not
less alone. Yet I thank God too! I have not
within me one of those melancholy misgivings
that you seem haunted with. The worse the
world uses me, the better I think I am bound to
use myself. Nor shall any solicitousness after
the felicities of the next world (which yet I bless
God! I am not without care for) ever stifle the
satisfactions arising from a just confidence of receiving
some time or other, even here, the reparation
due to such unaccountable usage as I have
sustained in this.”<a name="Anchor_183" id="Anchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 183.">[183]</a></p>

<p>Mr. (afterwards Sir Henry) Sheres is frequently
referred to in the latter pages of the
“<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>,” but the friendship which sprang up between
him and Pepys dates from a period subsequent
to the completion of that work. Sheres
accompanied the Earl of Sandwich into Spain,
where he acquired that Spanish character which
clung to him through life. He returned to England
in September, 1667, carrying letters from
Lord Sandwich. Pepys found him “a good ingenious
man,” and was pleased with his discourse.</p>

<p>In the following month Sheres returned to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
Spain, being the bearer of a letter from Pepys
to Lord Sandwich.<a name="Anchor_184" id="Anchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 184.">[184]</a> Subsequently he was engaged
at Tangier, and received <abbr title="100 pounds"><i>£</i>100</abbr> for drawing
a plate of the fortification, as already related.<a name="Anchor_185" id="Anchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 185.">[185]</a>
He was grateful to Pepys for getting him the
money, and had a silver candlestick made after
a pattern he had seen in Spain, for keeping the
light from the eyes, and gave it to the Diarist.<a name="Anchor_186" id="Anchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 186.">[186]</a>
On the 5th of April, 1669, he treated the Pepys
household, at the Mulberry Garden, to a Spanish
<i>olio</i>, a dish of meat and savoury herbs, which
they greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>On the death of Sir Jonas Moore, Pepys
wrote to Colonel Legge (afterward Lord Dartmouth)
a strong letter of recommendation in
favour of Sheres, whom he describes “as one of
whose loyalty and duty to the King and his
Royal Highness and acceptance with them I
assure myself; of whose personal esteem and
devotion towards you (Col. Legge), of whose uprightness
of mind, universality of knowledge in all
useful learning particularly mathematics, and of
them those parts especially which relate to gunnery
and fortification; and lastly, of whose vigorous
assiduity and sobriety I dare bind myself
in asserting much farther than, on the like occasion,
I durst pretend to of any other’s undertaking,
or behalf of mine.”<a name="Anchor_187" id="Anchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 187.">[187]</a> Sheres obtained the appointment,
and served under Lord Dartmouth at
the demolition of Tangier in 1683. He appears
to have been knighted in the following year, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
to have devoted himself to literature in later life.
He translated “Polybius,” and some “Dialogues”
of Lucian, and was the author of a pretty song.
His name occurs among those who received
mourning rings on the occasion of Pepys’s death.</p>

<p>Raleigh said, “There is nothing more becoming
any wise man than to make choice of
friends, for by them thou shalt be judged what
thou art.” If so, it speaks well for Pepys that
the names of most of the worthies of his time are
to be found amongst his correspondents. Newton
and Wallis stand out among the philosophers;
the two Gales (Thomas and Roger), Evelyn, and
Bishop Gibson among antiquaries and historians;
Kneller among artists; and Bishop Compton
and Nelson, the author of the “Festivals and
Fasts,” among theologians.</p>

<p>The letters of some of these men have been
printed in the “Correspondence” appended to
the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>,” and in Smith’s “Life, Journals,
and Correspondence of Samuel Pepys;” but
many more still remain in manuscript in various
collections.</p>

<p class="drop-cap noindent"><span class="upper-case">Our</span> literature is singularly deficient
in accounts of the official history
of the navy. There are numerous
books containing lives of seamen
and the history of naval actions,
but little has been written on the management
at home. The best account of naval affairs is
to be found in the valuable “Tracts” of the
stout old sailor Sir William Monson, which are
printed in “Churchill’s Voyages.”<a name="Anchor_188" id="Anchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 188.">[188]</a></p>

<p>Sir William was sent to the Tower in 1616,
and his zeal in promoting an inquiry into the
state of the navy, contrary to the wishes of the
Earl of Nottingham, then Lord High Admiral,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
is supposed to have been the cause of his
trouble.</p>

<p>The establishment of the navy, during a long
period of English history, was of a very simple
nature. The first admiral by name in England
was W. de Leybourne, who was appointed to
that office by Edward <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr>, in the year 1286,
under the title of “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Admiral de la Mer du Roy
d’Angleterre</span>,” and the first Lord High Admiral
was created by Richard <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> about a century
afterwards. This word “admiral” was introduced
into Europe from the East, and is nothing
more than the Arabic <i lang="ar-Latn" xml:lang="ar-Latn">amir-al</i><a name="Anchor_189" id="Anchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 189.">[189]</a> (in which form
the article is incorporated with the noun). The
intrusive <em>d</em>, however, made its appearance at
a very early period. The office of “Clerk of
the King’s Ships,” or “of the Navy,” afterwards
“Clerk of the Acts of the Navy,” is in all probability
a very ancient one, but the first holder
of the office whose name Colonel Pasley, R.E.,<a name="Anchor_190" id="Anchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 190.">[190]</a>
has met with, is Thomas Roger or Rogiers,
who lived in the reigns of Edward <abbr title="the Fourth">IV.</abbr>,
Edward <abbr title="the Fifth">V.</abbr>, and Richard <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr> In the third
volume of Pepys’s <abbr title="manuscript">MS.</abbr> “Miscellanies” (page 87)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
is an entry of an order, dated 18th May, 22
Edw. <abbr title="the Fourth">IV.</abbr> (1482), to the Treasurer and Chamberlain
of the Exchequer, to examine and clear the
account of “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">our well beloved Thomas Roger,
<abbr title="Esqire">Esq.</abbr>, Clerk of our Ships</span>.” In Harleian manuscript
433, which is believed to have belonged
to Lord Burghley, there is a register of grants
passing the Great Seal during the reigns of
Edward <abbr title="the Fifth">V.</abbr> and Richard <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr>, and <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 1690
contains the appointment of “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">Thomas Rogiers
to be clerc of all maner shippes to the King
belonging</span>.” It has no date, but is very probably
a reappointment by Richard <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr> on his
assumption of the crown.</p>

<p>The navy owes much to Henry <abbr title="the Eighth">VIII.</abbr>, who
reconstituted the Admiralty, founded the Trinity
House, and established the dockyards at Deptford,
Woolwich, and Portsmouth. The origin
of the board of “Principal Officers and Commissioners
of the Navy,” commonly called in later
times “the Navy Board,” dates from his reign.
His predecessors had usually themselves managed
whatever naval force they possessed, assisted by
their Privy Council, and by the officer already
alluded to, who was styled “Clerk” or “Keeper”
of the King’s ships, but in Henry’s time the
rapidly increasing magnitude and importance of
the navy rendered a more complete and better
organized system of management necessary. To
supply this want several new offices were created,
and before Henry’s death we find, in addition to
the Lord High Admiral and the Clerk of the

a Comptroller, and a Surveyor of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
Navy,<a name="Anchor_191" id="Anchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 191.">[191]</a> as well as a Keeper of the Naval Storehouses
at Erith and Deptford.<a name="Anchor_192" id="Anchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 192.">[192]</a> A few years
later we meet with a “Master of the Ordnance
of the Ships.” This last office, which had been
held by Sir William Woodhouse, was granted
by Philip and Mary in 1557 to William (afterwards
Sir William) Winter in addition to that
of Surveyor, to which he had been appointed by
Edward VI.<a name="Anchor_193" id="Anchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 193.">[193]</a></p>

<p>Each of these officers must have received
some sort of instructions for his guidance, but
no general code of rules for the administration
of the navy was framed until after the accession
of Elizabeth, who issued, about 1560, a set of
regulations for “the Office of the Admiralty and
Marine Causes,” with the following preamble:<a name="Anchor_194" id="Anchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 194.">[194]</a>&mdash;“Forasmuch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
as since the erection of the said
office by our late dear father Henry <abbr title="the Eighth">VIII.</abbr>, there
hath been no certain ordinance established so as
every officer in his degree is appointed to his
charge: and considering that in these our days
our navy is one of the chiefest defences of us
and our realm against the malice of any foreign
potentate: we have therefore thought good by
great advice and deliberation to make certain
ordinances and decrees, which our pleasure and
express commandment is that all our officers
shall on their parts execute and follow as they
tender our pleasure, and will answer to the contrary.”</p>

<p>Then follows a list of the several officers at
that time forming the Board, <abbr title="videlicet">viz.</abbr>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="allin noindent">
1. The Vice-Admiral.<br />
2. The Master of the Ordnance and Surveyor of the Navy: one officer.<br />
3. The Treasurer.<br />
4. The Comptroller.<br />
5. The General Surveyor of the Victuals.<br />
6. The Clerk of the Ships.<br />
7. The Clerk of the Stores.<a name="Anchor_195" id="Anchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 195.">[195]</a><br />
</p>

<p>The officers were to meet at least once a week
at the office on Tower Hill, to consult, and take
measures for the benefit of the navy, and were
further directed to make a monthly report of
their proceedings to the Lord Admiral.</p>

<p>The particular instructions which follow are
brief, and by no means explicit:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The Master of the Ordnance is to take care
to make the wants of his department known to
the Lord Admiral in good time, and he is to
obtain the signatures of three of his colleagues
every quarter to his books and accounts, which
are then to be submitted to the Court of Exchequer.</p>

<p>2. The Treasurer is to make no payments
except on the warrant of at least two of his colleagues,
and his books are to be made up and
certified by a similar number of the officers every
quarter.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>
<p>3. The Surveyor-General of the Victuals is to
have his issues warranted, and his accounts certified
in the same manner. He is to take care
always to have in store a sufficient stock of victuals
to supply a thousand men at sea for one
month at a fortnight’s notice.</p>

<p>4. The Surveyor, Comptroller, Clerk of the
Ships, and Clerk of the Stores are to see the
Queen’s ships grounded and trimmed from time
to time, and to keep them in such order that
upon fourteen days’ warning twelve or sixteen
sail may be ready for sea, and the rest soon
after. They are to make a monthly report of
the state of the ships to the Vice-Admiral and
the other officers.</p>

<p>5. The Clerk of the Ships is to provide timber
and other materials for building and repairing
ships.</p>

<p>6. The Clerk of the Stores is to keep a perfect
record of receipts and issues: the latter to be
made on the warrant of at least two of the officers.</p>

<p>This most interesting and important document
is concluded in the following words:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Item, our pleasure and commandment is
that all our said officers do agree in one consultation,
and all such necessary orders as shall
be taken amongst them from time to time to be
entered in a ledger book for the whole year, to
remain on record.</p>

<p>“The assistants not to be accounted any of
our head officers, but yet to travel in our courses
when they shall be thereunto commanded or appointed
by our Lord Admiral or Vice Admiral,
or other our officers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>“Item, our mind and pleasure is that every
of our said officers shall see into their fellows’
offices, to the intent that when God shall dispose
His will upon any of them they living may be
able, if we prefer any of them, to receive the
same.</p>

<p>“These our ordinances to be read once a
quarter amongst our officers, so as thereby every
of them may the better understand his duty, and
to be safely kept in our Consultation house at
Tower Hill.”</p>

<p>We will now return to Sir William Monson,
who, in his “Naval Tracts,” answers the question
what kind of men are to be chosen for the various
offices. He suggests that “the Comptroller’s
and Clerk’s places be reduced into one, who
should be an experienced clerk, <em>long bred in
the office</em>.... Provided always, that besides
their experience and abilities to perform the
active part of His Majesty’s service, these men
be of good substance and esteem in their
estates.”</p>

<p>Such a rule as this would have excluded Pepys
from the service, as he knew nothing of the
navy when he was made Clerk of the Acts.
He soon, however, made himself master of his
business, and at the time of his death he was
esteemed the greatest authority on naval affairs.
In illustration of Monson’s recommendation, it
may be remarked that in 1585 the two offices of
Clerk and Comptroller were held by the same
man, William Borough.</p>

<p>The salaries received by the various officers
are set down by Monson as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Although the salary of the Clerk of the Acts
is here put at over one hundred pounds, yet the
ancient “fee out of the Exchequer,” which was attached
to the office, did not amount to more than
<abbr title="33 pounds 6 shillings 8 pence"><i>£</i>33 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i></abbr> per annum, and this sum is specially
set forth in Pepys’s patent.</p>

<p>In July, 1660, the salaries of the officers of the
navy (with the exception of that of the Treasurer)
were advanced, Pepys’s being raised to
<abbr title="350 pounds"><i>£</i>350</abbr>.<a name="Anchor_197" id="Anchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 197.">[197]</a> The salary of the Treasurer remained

<p>When the Duke of Buckingham was assassinated,
in 1628, the office of Lord High Admiral
was for the first time put into commission. All
the great officers of State were Commissioners,
and Edward Nicholas, who had been secretary
to Lord Zouch and to the Duke of Buckingham,
was appointed Secretary of the Admiralty.</p>

<p>During the Commonwealth both the Admiralty
and the Navy Office were administered
by bodies of Commissioners. The offices of
Comptroller, Surveyor, and Clerk of the Acts
were abolished, and although the Treasurer remained,
he was not a member of the Navy
Board. Robert Blackburne, who was Secretary
to most of the Commissions of the Admiralty,
entertained Pepys after the Restoration with an
account of the doings of the members. He told
him that Sir William Penn got promotion by
making a pretence of sanctity; and he then
mimicked the actions of the Commissioners, who,
he affirmed, would ask the admirals and captains
respecting certain men, and say with a sigh and
a casting up of the eyes, “Such a man fears the
Lord;” or, “I hope such a man hath the Spirit
of God.”<a name="Anchor_199" id="Anchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 199.">[199]</a></p>

<p>At the Restoration the Duke of York was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
appointed Lord High Admiral, and all powers
formerly granted to the Admiralty and Navy
Board were recalled.<a name="Anchor_200" id="Anchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 200.">[200]</a> By the Duke’s advice a
committee was named to consider a plan proposed
by himself for the future regulation of the
affairs of the navy; and at a court held on July
4th, 1660, three new commissioners (John Lord
Berkeley, Sir William Penn, and Peter Pett) were
appointed to assist the four principal officers.
Pett was to be employed at Chatham dockyard,
but the other two had no special duties assigned
to them, although their appointment gave them
equal power with the original members when
they attended at the Board. As there was at
this time no half-pay, these appointments were
considered as affording a convenient means of
granting a comfortable subsistence to an admiral
when not at sea. Lord Clarendon strongly
disapproved of this innovation, and attributed
the idea to Sir William Coventry, who wished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
to reduce the power and emoluments of the
Treasurer.<a name="Anchor_201" id="Anchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 201.">[201]</a></p>

<p>In January, 1661–62, James Duke of York
issued Instructions which were founded on those
drawn up by the Earl of Northumberland,
Lord High Admiral from 1638 to 1644, and
remained in force until the reorganization of
the Admiralty at the beginning of the present
century.</p>

<p>It is here necessary to stop a moment for the
purpose of noticing Pepys’s relation to these
Instructions. Before the publication of the
“<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>” it was supposed that he was the chief
author of the Rules. In the first Report of the
Commissioners of Naval Revision (13th June,
1805) it is distinctly stated that he drew them
up under the direction of the Duke, and even
Lord Braybrooke makes the claim in regard to
Pepys’s authorship. This is an error, and
Colonel Pasley points out that at the date of the
issue of the Regulations Pepys was by no means
on intimate terms with James. Even two years
later (4th March, 1633–34) he writes, “I never
had so much discourse with the Duke before,
and till now did ever fear to meet him;” but
what really settles the matter is, that under date
February 5th, 1661–62, Pepys writes: “Sir G.
Carteret, the two Sir Williams, and myself all
alone reading of the Duke’s institutions for the
settlement of our office, whereof we read as much
as concerns our own duties, and left the other
officers for another time.” The latter of these
important passages was not printed by Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
Braybrooke, and is only to be found in the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr>
Mynors Bright’s transcript.<a name="Anchor_202" id="Anchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 202.">[202]</a></p>

<p>The Navy Office, as we see from the
“<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>,” was by no means a happy family.
Each officer was jealous of his fellow, and this
jealousy was somewhat fostered by the duties
enjoined. Pepys constantly complains of the
neglect by his colleagues of their several duties,
and when the Duke of York returned from his
command at the end of the first great Dutch
war, he found the office in the greatest disorder.
This caused the preparation of the Diarist’s
“great letter” to the Duke, which is referred to
in the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>,” on November 17th, 1666. A
still more important letter, on the same subject,
written by Pepys, but purporting to come from
the pen of the Duke of York, was not prepared
until nearly two years after this.<a name="Anchor_203" id="Anchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 203.">[203]</a> We learn
from the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>” all the stages of progress of
this letter, the effect it produced when read out
at the office,<a name="Anchor_204" id="Anchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 204.">[204]</a> and the way in which the officers
prepared their answers.<a name="Anchor_205" id="Anchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 205.">[205]</a> In his allusion to this
letter, Lord Braybrooke again does some injustice
to James, for he writes: “We even find in
the ‘<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>,’ as early as 1668, that a long letter
of regulation, produced before the Commissioners
of the Navy by the Duke of York <em>as his
own composition</em>, was entirely written by the
Clerk of the Acts.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>Colonel Pasley very justly observes, in commenting
on this view of the Lord High Admiral’s
position:&mdash;“There is nothing unusual or
improper in a minister, or head of a department,
employing his subordinates to prepare documents
for his signature, and in this particular
instance it was evidently of importance that the
actual author should remain unknown. Not
only was Pepys himself most anxious to avoid
being known in the matter, but it is obvious that
the authority and effect of the reprimand and
warning would have been much lessened, if the
other members of the Board had been aware
that the Duke had no other knowledge of the
abuses of the office than what Pepys told him.
It seems from the ‘<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>,’ that about 1668
Pepys first obtained the complete confidence of
the Duke&mdash;a confidence which he always after
retained and never abused. It is evident from
numerous remarks in his manuscripts that Pepys
had the highest respect for James’s opinion in
naval matters. In fact, the mutual respect and
friendship of these two men was equally honourable
to both, and it is a mistake to endeavour
to magnify one at the expense of the other.”</p>

<p>The letter referred to is in the British Museum,<a name="Anchor_206" id="Anchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 206.">[206]</a>
and as it is of considerable interest in the
life of Pepys, it will be worth while to devote a
small space to a few notes on its contents.</p>

<p>James refers to his former letter of January<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
2nd, 1661, sent with the “Instructions,” as well as
to that of March 22nd, 1664, and, after some
general remarks, he points out the particular
duty of each officer, finishing with remarks on
their joint duties as a Board. The letter is
drawn up in so orderly a manner, and discovers
so thorough a knowledge of the details of the
office, that there is little cause for surprise that
the officers suspected Pepys to be the author.
Article by article of the “Instructions” are set
down, and following each of them are remarks
on the manner in which it had been carried out.
It is very amusing to notice the tact with which
our Diarist gets over the difficulty of criticizing
his own deeds. The Duke is made to say that
although he has inquired as to the execution
of the office of Clerk of the Acts, he cannot
hear of any particular to charge him with failure
in his duty, and as he finds that the Clerk had
given diligent attendance, he thinks that the
duty must have been done well, particularly
during the time of the war, when, in spite of the
work being greater, the despatch was praiseworthy.
Yet he would not express further satisfaction,
but would be willing to receive any
information of the Clerk’s failures which otherwise
might have escaped his knowledge. The
officers were informed that an answer was required
from each of them within fourteen days.
When these answers were received, Pepys set to
work to write a reply for the Duke to acknowledge.
Matthew Wren, the Duke’s secretary,
smoothed down the language of this letter<a name="Anchor_207" id="Anchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 207.">[207]</a> a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
little, but it still remained a very stinging reprimand.
These two letters form, probably, the
most complete instance of a severe “wigging”
given by the head of an office to his staff.</p>

<p>We will now return to the consideration of
the business management of the navy, and it is
necessary for us to bear in mind that the offices
of the Admiralty and of the Navy Board were
quite distinct in their arrangements. The Navy
Board formed the Council of the Lord High
Admiral, and the Admiralty was, originally,
merely his personal office, the locality of which
changed with his own change of residence, or
that of his secretary. It was at one time in
Whitehall, at another in Cannon Row, Westminster;
and when Pepys was secretary, it was
attached to his house in York Buildings.</p>

<p>When, however, there was a Board of Admiralty
in place of a Lord High Admiral, the
Admiralty Office became of more importance,
and the Navy Office relatively of less.</p>

<p>According to Pepys, there was some talk of
putting the office of Lord High Admiral into
commission in the year 1668,<a name="Anchor_208" id="Anchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 208.">[208]</a> but it was not so
treated until June, 1673, when the Duke of
York laid down all his offices. The Commissioners
on this occasion were Prince Rupert, the
three great officers of State, three dukes, two
secretaries, Sir G. Carteret, and Edward Seymour
(afterwards Speaker of the House of Commons);
and Pepys was the secretary. Before the commission
passed the Great Seal, the King did the
business through the medium of Pepys.<a name="Anchor_209" id="Anchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 209.">[209]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>Lords of the Admiralty were occasionally appointed
to assist the Lord High Admiral, or to
fill his place while he was abroad. Pepys refers
to such Lords on November 14th, 1664, and in
March of the following year he remarks: “The
best piece of news is, that instead of a great
many troublesome Lords, the whole business is
to be left with the Duke of Albemarle to act as
Admiral.”<a name="Anchor_210" id="Anchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 210.">[210]</a></p>

<p>These lords were not properly commissioners,
as a commission was only appointed by the King
when the office of Lord High Admiral was
vacant, but they formed a deputation or committee
appointed by the Admiral to act as his
deputies.</p>

<p>Pepys was with the Duke of York previous
to the reinstatement of the latter as Lord High
Admiral, he returned to the office with his
patron, and he continued secretary until the Revolution,
when he retired into private life. On
the Duke’s accession to the throne a new board
was formed and the navy was again raised to a
state of efficiency.</p>

<p>Pepys was Clerk of the Acts from 1660 to
1672, that is, during the whole period of the
“<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>,” and three years afterwards. He was
succeeded by his clerk, Thomas Hayter, and
his brother John Pepys, who held the office
jointly. As already stated, Pepys was promoted
to be Secretary of the Admiralty in 1672,
and continued in office until 1679, when he was
again succeeded for a time by Hayter. We
know comparatively little of him in the higher
office, and it is as Clerk of the Acts that he is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
familiar to us. With regard to this position
it is necessary to bear in mind that the “so-called”
clerk, as well as being secretary, was also
a member of the Board, and one of the “principal
officers.” On one occasion Pepys met Sir
G. Carteret, Sir J. Minnes, and Sir W. Batten
at Whitehall, and when the King spied them
out, he cried, “Here is the Navy Office!”<a name="Anchor_211" id="Anchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 211.">[211]</a></p>

<p>I have already mentioned that the principal
officers were superseded during the Commonwealth.
Again, in 1686, they were suspended,
and the offices were temporarily placed under a
body of equal commissioners.</p>

<p>The Navy Office, where Pepys lived during
the whole period over which the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>” extends,
was situated between Crutched Friars
and Seething Lane, with an entrance in each of
these places. The ground was originally occupied
by a chapel and college attached to the
church of Allhallows, Barking, but these buildings
were pulled down in the year 1548, and the
land was used for some years as a garden plot.</p>

<p>In Elizabeth’s reign, when the celebrated Sir
William Wynter, Surveyor of Her Majesty’s
Ships, brought home from sea much plunder of
merchants’ goods, a storehouse of timber and
brick was raised on this site for their reception. In
course of time the storehouse made way for the
Navy Office, a rather extensive building, in which
the civil business of the navy was transacted until
the last quarter of the eighteenth century. On
July 4th, 1660, Pepys went with Commissioner
Pett to view the houses, and was very pleased<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
with them, but he feared that the more influential
officers would shuffle him out of his rights.
Two days afterwards, however, he went with
Mr. Coventry and Sir G. Carteret to take possession
of the place; still, although his mind was
a little cheered, his hopes were not great. On
July 9th, he began to sign bills in his office, and
on the 18th he records the fact that he dined in
his own apartments.</p>

<p>Pepys’s house was a part of the Seething
Lane front, and that occupied by Sir William
Penn was on the north side of the garden, a
house which was afterwards occupied by Lord
Brouncker.<a name="Anchor_212" id="Anchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 212.">[212]</a> When the new Somerset House
was finished, the Navy Office was removed there,
and the old buildings in the city were sold and
destroyed.</p>

<p>In course of time the work of the navy could
not be properly carried out with the old machinery,
and, at last, the Admiralty Office, which
had largely grown in importance, swallowed up
the Navy Office. By an Act of Parliament,
2 William <abbr title="the Fourth">IV.</abbr>, the principal officers and commissioners
of the navy were abolished, as were
also the commissioners for victualling the navy;
and all power and authority was vested in the
Admiralty.</p>

<p>I have attempted to give in a few pages as
clear an account as possible of the kind of
machinery by which the navy was governed,
and I now propose to pass rapidly in review
a few of the points raised by Pepys. To
do more than glance at some of these would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
require a volume. The “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>” is filled with
information respecting the office and the petty
squabbles of the officers, and we obtain from it
a gloomy notion of the condition of the navy.
In fact, it would be hardly possible to believe
the wretched details if we had them from a less
trustworthy authority. The whole system of
money-getting was unsatisfactory in the extreme,
and the officers of the navy were often expected
to perform the task of making bricks without
straw. The Treasurer, not being able to get
money from the Treasury, floated bills, and
these were often in very bad repute. We read
in the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>,” that on August 31st, 1661, the
bills were offered to be sold on the Exchange at
10 per cent. loss; and on April 14th, 1663,
things were even worse, for it was reported that
they were sold at a reduction of 15 per cent.
In December of the latter year Pepys could
hardly believe the evidence of his ears when he
learned the “extraordinary good news,” that the
credit of the office was “as good as any merchant’s
upon Change;” but these bright days did
not last long. Parliament being very dissatisfied
with the way in which the money was spent by
the officers of the navy, appointed, a few years
afterwards, a commission to look into the accounts.
This gave Pepys much trouble, which
he did not relish, and we find him busy in
making things as pleasant as possible during the
latter part of 1666. He was in “mighty fear
and trouble” when called before the committee,
the members of which appeared to be “in a very
ill humour.” Three years after this he drew up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
a letter to the Commissioners of Accounts on
the state of the office, a transcript of which, addressed
to “H. R. H. the Lord High Admiral,”
and dated January 8th, 1669–70, is now in the
library of the British Museum.<a name="Anchor_213" id="Anchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 213.">[213]</a></p>

<p>One of the most unsatisfactory divisions of
the naval accounts related to the pursers. Pepys
was early interested in the Victualling Department,
out of which he afterwards made much
money; and on September 12th, 1662, we find
him trying “to understand the method of making
up Purser’s Accounts, which is very needful for
me and very hard.” On November 22nd, 1665,
he remarks that he was pleased to have it demonstrated
“that a Purser without professed
cheating is a professed loser twice as much as
he gets.” Pepys received his appointment of
Surveyor-General of the Victualling Office chiefly
through the influence of Sir William Coventry,
and on January 1st, 1665–6, he addressed a letter
and “New Yeares Guift” on the subject of
pursers to his distinguished friend. He relates
in the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>” how he wrote the letter, and
how Sir William praised his work to the Duke.<a name="Anchor_214" id="Anchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 214.">[214]</a></p>

<p>The want of money led to other evils that
brought the greatest discredit upon the Navy
Office. The tickets that were given to the men
in place of money, were received with the
greatest disgust, and during the time of the
Dutch war the scarcity of sailors was so great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
that a wholesale system of pressing was resorted
to. We learn that on June 30th, 1666, Sir
Thomas Bludworth, the Lord Mayor, impressed
a large number of persons wholly unfit for sea,
and when we are further told that some of them
were “people of very good fashion,” it is not
surprising that Pepys should call the Mayor “a
silly man.”</p>

<p>So great was the disgust of the unpaid men,
that during the war with Holland English sailors
positively preferred to serve in the ships of the
enemies of England rather than fight for their
own country, and when the Dutch were in the
Medway English voices were heard from Dutch
ships.<a name="Anchor_215" id="Anchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 215.">[215]</a></p>

<p>The seamen were not likely to learn much
good from their superiors, for throughout the
whole fleet swearing, drinking, and debauchery
were rampant.<a name="Anchor_216" id="Anchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 216.">[216]</a></p>

<p>A great part of the evils arose from the appointment
of so-called “gentlemen captains,”
men who were unacquainted with maritime
affairs, and treated the sailor captains with contempt,
calling them tarpaulins, a name which
now only remains to us in the reduced form of
tar. This evil was well known in the reign of
Elizabeth, and was pointed out by Gibson, who
wrote memoirs of the expeditions of the navy
from 1585 to 1603,<a name="Anchor_217" id="Anchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 217.">[217]</a> and all readers are familiar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
with Macaulay’s remarks on the same subject.
Captain Digby, a son of the Earl of Bristol,
and one of these “ornamental officers,” after he
had been in the fleet about a year expressed the
wish that he might not again see a tarpaulin
have the command of a ship.<a name="Anchor_218" id="Anchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 218.">[218]</a> These useless
captains, who could make bows, but could not
navigate a ship, raised the ire of old Nan Clarges,
otherwise Duchess of Albemarle, who “cried
out mightily against the having of gentlemen
captains with feathers and ribbands, and wished
the king would send her husband to sea with
the old plain sea captains that he served with
formerly, that would make their ships swim with
blood, though they could not make legs as
captains now-a-days can.”<a name="Anchor_219" id="Anchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 219.">[219]</a></p>

<p>The common custom of employing indiscriminately
land officers as admirals, and naval
officers as generals, often led to disasters.
There can be no doubt of the bravery of Monk
and Rupert, but when on shipboard they made
many blunders and endangered the safety of the
fleet.</p>

<p>All this confusion caused dire disasters, which
culminated in the presence of the hostile Dutch
fleet in our rivers; a national disgrace which no
Englishman can think of even now without a
feeling of shame. While reading the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>“<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>,”
we are overwhelmed with the instances of gross
mismanagement in naval affairs. Many of the
men whose carelessness helped to increase the
amount of rampant blundering were, however,
capable of deeds of pluck and bravery. In one
of the engagements with the Dutch, Prince
Rupert sent his pleasure-boat, the “Fanfan,”
with two small guns on board, against the Dutch
admiral, De Ruyter. With great daring, the
sailors brought their little boat near, and fired
at De Ruyter’s vessel for two hours, but at last
a ball did them so much damage that the crew
were forced to row briskly to save their lives.<a name="Anchor_220" id="Anchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 220.">[220]</a></p>

<p>Another instance of bravery more deserving
of honour is that recorded of Captain Douglas,
of the “Royal Oak,” who had received orders
to defend his ship at Chatham. This he did
with the utmost resolution, but, having had no
order to retire, he chose rather to be burnt in his
ship than live to be reproached with having
deserted his command. It is reported that Sir
William Temple expressed the wish that Cowley
had celebrated this noble deed before he
died.<a name="Anchor_221" id="Anchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 221.">[221]</a></p>

<p>Pepys tells us that on July 21st, 1668, he
went to his “plate-makers,” and spent an hour
in contriving some plates for his books of the
King’s four yards, and that on the 27th of the
same month the four plates came home. They
cost him five pounds, and he was in consequence
both troubled and pleased.</p>

<p>No account of the state of the navy in Charles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
<abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr>’s time, however short, would be complete without
some notice of the four dockyards (Chatham,
Deptford, Portsmouth, and Woolwich), which
necessarily occupy a very prominent place in the
“<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>.” Chatham yard was founded by Queen
Elizabeth, and it remained under the special
charge of the Surveyor of the Navy until a
Special Commissioner was appointed in 1630.
This explains a passage in the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>” which
has not hitherto been illustrated. When, in
April, 1661, Sir William Batten, the Surveyor
of the Navy, and Pepys were on a visit to Chatham,
they went “to see Commissioner Pett’s
house, he and his family being absent, and here
I wondered how my Lady Batten walked up
and down, with envious looks, to see how neat
and rich everything is, saying that she would
get it, for it belonged formerly to the Surveyor
of the Navy.”<a name="Anchor_222" id="Anchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 222.">[222]</a> The first Commissioner was
Phineas Pett, who died in 1647, and was succeeded
by his son, Peter Pett, who figures so
frequently in the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>.” Peter was continued
in office at the Restoration, but he was suspended
in 1667 in consequence of the success of the
Dutch attack upon Chatham. He was sent to
the Tower and threatened with impeachment,
but, although the threat was not carried out, he
was never restored to office. The appointment
remained in abeyance for two years after, when,
in March, 1669, Captain John Cox, the master<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
attendant at Deptford, was made resident Commissioner
at Chatham. In January, 1672, he
was appointed flag captain to the Duke of
York, in the “Prince,” without vacating his
office at Chatham, was knighted in April, and
killed at the battle of Solebay in May, all in the
same year.</p>

<p>The Hill-house that Pepys visited for the first
time on the 8th of April, 1661, is frequently
mentioned on subsequent pages of the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>.”<a name="Anchor_223" id="Anchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 223.">[223]</a>
The “old Edgeborrow,” whose ghost was reported
to haunt the place, was Kenrick Edisbury,
Surveyor of the Navy from 1632 to 1638.
Pepys does not seem quite to have appreciated
the story of the ghost which was told him as he
went to bed after a merry supper, although he
affirms that he was not so much afraid as for
mirth’s sake he seemed.<a name="Anchor_224" id="Anchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 224.">[224]</a> In the “Memoirs of
English Affairs, chiefly Naval, from the year 1660
to 1673, written by James, Duke of York,” there
is a letter from James to the principal officers of
the navy (dated May 10th, 1661), in which he
recommends that the lease of the Hill-house
should be bought by them, if it can be obtained
at a reasonable rate, as the said house “is very
convenient for the service of his Majesty’s
Navy.”<a name="Anchor_225" id="Anchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 225.">[225]</a></p>

<p>After the defeat of the Spanish Armada, Sir
Francis Drake and Sir John Hawkins advised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
the establishment of a chest at Chatham for the
relief of seamen wounded in their country’s service,
and the sailors voluntarily agreed to have
certain sums “defalked” out of their wages in
order to form this fund. In July, 1662, Pepys
was told of the abuse of the funds, and advised
to look into the business.<a name="Anchor_226" id="Anchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 226.">[226]</a> At the end of the
same year a commission was appointed to inspect
the chest,<a name="Anchor_227" id="Anchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 227.">[227]</a> but the commissioners do not
seem to have done much good, for in 1667
there was positively no money left to pay the
poor sailors what was owed to them.<a name="Anchor_228" id="Anchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 228.">[228]</a> After a
time the property became considerable, but unfortunately
the abuses grew as well. In 1802
the chest was removed to Greenwich, and in
1817 the stock is said to have amounted to
<abbr title="300,000 pounds"><i>£</i>300,000</abbr> consols.</p>

<p>Deptford dockyard was founded about the
year 1513. Pepys made occasional visits to it,
and on one occasion he and Coventry took the
officers (of whose honesty he had not a very
high opinion) by surprise. On June 16th, 1662,
he mentions going to see “in what forwardness
the work is for Sir W. Batten’s house and mine.”
He found the house almost ready, but we hear
no more of it in the subsequent pages of the
“<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>.”</p>

<p>Portsmouth dockyard was established by
Henry <abbr title="the Eighth">VIII.</abbr>, but it did not hold a foremost
position until, in the reign of William <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr>,
Edmund Dummer contrived a simple and
ingenious method of pumping water from dry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
docks below the level of low tide, which enabled
Portsmouth for the first time to possess a dry
dock capable of taking in a first-rate man-of-war.
It was Dummer who also designed and constructed
the first docks at Plymouth.<a name="Anchor_229" id="Anchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 229.">[229]</a></p>

<p>Sir Edward Montague first chose Portsmouth
as the place from which to draw his title, but
he afterwards gave the preference to Sandwich.</p>

<p>When Pepys visited Portsmouth in May, 1661,
he was very pleased with his reception by the
officers of the dockyard, who treated him with
much respect.</p>

<p>Although the date of the foundation of Woolwich
dockyard is not recorded, it is known to
have been of considerable importance in Henry
<abbr title="the Eighth">VIII.</abbr>’s reign. It figures very frequently in the
“<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>.”<a name="Anchor_230" id="Anchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 230.">[230]</a></p>

<p>Very soon after Pepys was settled in his office,
he thought it advisable to give his attention to
the question of the British dominion of the seas,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
and he made a special study of Selden’s “Mare
Clausum.” He intended to write a treatise on
the rights of the English flag, and present it to
the Duke of York. His reason for doing this
was that it promised to be a good way to make
himself known.<a name="Anchor_231" id="Anchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 231.">[231]</a> The right of making foreign
vessels strike their sails to the English flag had
been insisted upon from early times. Selden’s
work, in which the case was strongly urged, met
therefore with great favour. Charles <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr> made
an order in council that a copy should be kept
in the council chest, another in the Court of
Exchequer, and a third in the Court of Admiralty.
The upholders of this right triumphed
when, in the treaty of peace with the Dutch
(February 9th, 1674), the States-General confessed
that to be a right which before had been
styled courtesy, and they agreed that not only
separate ships, but whole fleets should strike
sails to any fleet or ship carrying the king’s flag.<a name="Anchor_232" id="Anchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 232.">[232]</a>
John Evelyn argued strongly in favour of England’s
right to the dominion of the sea in his
“Navigation and Commerce” (1674), but he
privately confessed to Pepys that he did not
consider there was any sufficient evidence of the
right.<a name="Anchor_233" id="Anchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 233.">[233]</a></p>

<p>We must now turn our attention to the Diarist’s
colleagues at the Navy Office, and it is here very
needful to caution the reader against putting
implicit faith in all the adverse remarks that fill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>.” It is a curious fact that, with the
exception of Sir William Coventry, scarcely any
of the officers come off with a good character.
Pepys held Coventry in profound respect, and
was never prouder than when he received a word
of praise from him, and yet we do not obtain a
very favourable idea of the secretary to the
Duke of York from other writers, and in the
pages of Clarendon we are presented with a very
adverse character of him.</p>

<p>Those officers with whom Pepys came most
in contact were Sir George Carteret, the Treasurer;
Sir Robert Slingsby and Sir John Minnes,
successive Comptrollers; Sir William Batten
and Colonel Thomas Middleton, successive Surveyors;
and Sir William Penn and Lord Viscount
Brouncker, additional Commissioners.</p>

<p>Pepys did not hold Carteret in much esteem,
and we read constant disparaging remarks respecting
him, such as that on one occasion he
wanted to know what the four letters S. P. Q. R.
meant, “which ignorance is not to be borne in a
Privy Counsellor,”<a name="Anchor_234" id="Anchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 234.">[234]</a> but after Sir George’s son
had married a daughter of Lord Sandwich, and
he had thus become a near connection of Pepys’s
family, we read of “his pleasant humour,” and
are told that he is “a most honest man.” Sir
Robert Slingsby died in 1661, and therefore does
not occupy a very prominent position in the
“<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>,” but Pepys grieved for his loss.</p>

<p>Sir John Minnes was better known as a wit
than as a sailor, and it was he who taught Pepys
to appreciate Chaucer. He does not, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
come off very handsomely in the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>.” Captain
Holmes called him “the veriest knave and
rogue and coward in the world,”<a name="Anchor_235" id="Anchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 235.">[235]</a> and Sir William
Coventry likened him to a lapwing, who was
always in a flutter to keep others from the nest.<a name="Anchor_236" id="Anchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 236.">[236]</a>
Pepys himself, after a few quarrels, hints pretty
plainly that he was an old coxcomb, a mere jester
or ballad-monger, and quite unfit for business.</p>

<p>We are told of Sir William Batten’s corruption
and underhand dealing,<a name="Anchor_237" id="Anchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 237.">[237]</a> of his knavery,<a name="Anchor_238" id="Anchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 238.">[238]</a>
and of his inconsequent action in objecting to
lighthouses generally, and then proposing one
for Harwich;<a name="Anchor_239" id="Anchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 239.">[239]</a> but Pepys’s two chief enemies
were Sir William Penn and Lord Brouncker.</p>

<p>Sir William Penn and Pepys were much
thrown together, and were alternately very
friendly and very jealous of each other. When
Pepys first associated with Penn, he found him
sociable but cunning, and ever after the pages
of the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>” are filled with vituperation respecting
this successful admiral. Considering
the eminent position of William Penn the son,
as a leader among the Quakers, it is curious to
note that before the Restoration, and when Monk
was coming from the North, it was reported that
Penn, the father, had turned Quaker.<a name="Anchor_240" id="Anchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 240.">[240]</a> In May,
1660, Charles <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> wrote to Monk: “I have so
good an opinion of General Penn, that if you
had not recommended him to me I would have
taken care of all his interests;”<a name="Anchor_241" id="Anchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 241.">[241]</a> and we cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
doubt that he possessed some eminent qualities
of which we learn nothing in the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>.”</p>

<p>Lord Brouncker was a good mathematician in
his own day, and his name has come down with
credit to ours as the first President of the Royal
Society, but his portrait as painted by Pepys is
far from a pleasing one&mdash;let us hope that it was
not a true likeness. He was not a rich man, for
his mother was a gamester, and his father a
land-lacking peer, and he was probably not over
particular as to the means he took to obtain
money. We may believe this, however, without
agreeing with Pepys that he was “a rotten-hearted,
false man.”<a name="Anchor_242" id="Anchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 242.">[242]</a> Aubrey says that the
following lines were written on his parents:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="p_line_i0">“Here’s a health to my Lady Brouncker, and the best card in her hand;</div>
    <div class="p_line_i0">And a health to my Lord her husband, with ne’er a foot of land.”<a name="Anchor_243" id="Anchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 243.">[243]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>These were some of the men who helped to
carry on the work of the English navy. It
would have been well for the fame of most of
them if Pepys had never put pen to paper.</p>

  In the “Succession of the Lords High Admiral,” <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>,
in Pepys’s “Naval Collections,” it is stated that on the Restoration
the existing Commissioners of the Admiralty and
of the Navy respectively were temporarily continued in
office by order in council of the 31st May, 1660. By a
subsequent order (7th July following) a Board of Principal
Officers and Commissioners of the Navy on the ancient
model was appointed, and the Duke of York was directed
to revoke the authority <em>he</em> had granted “unto the former
Treasurer, Officers, and Commissioners of the Navy.” It
would appear, therefore, that the Admiralty Commissioners
had been suppressed, and the Duke appointed Admiral at
some intermediate date between the 31st May and the 7th
July, 1660; although, according to Pepys’s list, quoted
above, his patent under the Great Seal bore date the 29th
January, 1660–61.&mdash;C.&nbsp;P.

  Dummer was Assistant to the Surveyor of the Navy
when he designed these works. The improvement of Portsmouth
and the foundation of a dockyard at Plymouth were
called for by the political changes arising out of the Revolution.
Previously our great naval wars had been waged
against the Dutch, and the Thames and Medway were then
the most convenient localities for fitting and repairing ships
of war. After the Revolution, the Dutch became our allies,
and the French our most formidable enemies. The naval
ports on the Channel then became more important than
those on the east coast.&mdash;C.&nbsp;P.

<p class="drop-cap noindent"><span class="upper-case">The</span> Court of Charles <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> was not
unlike that of Comus, for drunkenness
and vice reigned supreme in
both. Pepys’s “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>” forms a
valuable antidote to the Grammont
“Memoirs,” because in the latter work the
pictures are drawn in rose colour, while in the
former we see the squalid poverty that accompanied
the wasteful extravagance. In the courts
of most of our sovereigns statesmen have borne
an important part, but at the Restoration the
court was formed of wits and beautiful women
only. Then statesmen moved in the outer circles,
and were laughed at by those who dwelt in the
inner ones. Grammont relates that the Earl of
Arlington was one day offering his humble services<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
and best advice to Miss Stewart, to assist
her in conducting herself as King’s mistress, a
situation “to which it had pleased God and her
virtue to raise her!” He had only just begun
his speech, “when she recollected that he was at
the head of those whom the Duke of Buckingham
used to mimic; and as his presence and
his language exactly revived the ridiculous ideas
that had been given her of him, she could not
forbear bursting out into a fit of laughter in his
face, so much the more violent as she had for a
long time struggled to suppress it.” It is not to
be supposed that Pepys could know much of the
inner circle of the court, but still there was much
gossip about those who composed it, and he sets
down many tales in his “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>” respecting the
doings of the too celebrated ladies. Several
of the stories which were supposed to have
owed much to the lively imaginations of Counts
Hamilton and Grammont, are corroborated by
Pepys.<a name="Anchor_244" id="Anchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 244.">[244]</a> The wild frolic of Miss Jennings and
Miss Price, to which allusion will be made <a href="#Ref_Mrs_Jennings" title="Go to reference">later
on in this chapter</a>, is not overlooked by Pepys.<a name="Anchor_245" id="Anchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 245.">[245]</a>
Miss Jennings was not singular in her freak, and
Bishop Burnet relates that about the year 1668,
the King and Queen and all the court went
about disguised in sedan chairs to houses where
they were not known. On one occasion the
Queen’s chairmen, not knowing who she was,
left her alone, and she had to get back to Whitehall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
as best she could in a hackney coach or in a
cart. The same masqueradings went on in the
country as in town; and in 1670 the Queen, the
Duchess of Richmond, the Duchess of Buckingham,
and some others, disguised themselves as
country lasses, in red petticoats, waistcoats, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>,
in order to visit the fair at Audley End. The
grand ladies and their companions overacted
their parts, and were soon discovered, so that
they were glad to escape as best they could from
the crowd that gathered round them.</p>

</div>

<p>Pepys seems to have held the vulgar opinion
that the great people ought to converse in a more
distinguished tone than ordinary mortals, and he
constantly remarks on the commonplace character
of the King’s talk. On October 26th, 1664,
there was a launch at Woolwich, attended by
the King and his Court, which is fully described
by our Diarist, who remarks: “But Lord! the
sorry talke and discourse among the great courtiers
round about him, without any reverence in
the world, but so much disorder. By and by
the Queene comes and her Mayds of Honour;
one whereof M<span class="super">rs</span>. Boynton, and the Duchesse of
Buckingham had been very sicke coming by
water in the barge (the water being very rough);
but what silly sport they made with them in very
common terms, <em>methought was very poor and
below what people think these great people say and
do</em>.”</p>

<p>On the 15th of November, 1666, there was a
grand ball at court, that day being the Queen’s
birthday; and Pepys and his wife went to see
the dancing, which they found very tiresome.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
The ladies, however, were pleasant to look upon,
and their dresses very rich; so we read in the
“<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>:” “Away home with my wife, between
displeased with the dull dancing and satisfied
with the clothes and persons.”</p>

<p>These ladies owe much of their fame to the
series of portraits which still exists to show a later
age the outward forms that charmed the men of
two centuries ago. We are told in the Grammont
“Memoirs” that, “the Duchess of York
being desirous of having the portraits of the
handsomest persons at court, Lely painted them,
and employed all his skill in the performance;
nor could he ever exert himself upon more
beautiful subjects. Every picture appeared a
masterpiece; and that of Miss Hamilton appeared
the highest finished: Lely himself acknowledged
that he had drawn it with a particular
pleasure.” Next to the deshabille, in which
most of these ladies are arranged, the most
noticeable feature in these portraits is the soft,
sleepy eye&mdash;a supposed beauty that was attained
to after a considerable amount of practice:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="p_line_i0">“&mdash;&mdash; on the animated canvas stole</div>
    <div class="p_line_i0">The sleepy eye, that spoke the melting soul.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Mrs. Hyde, the first wife of Henry Hyde,
afterwards second Earl of Clarendon, had by
long practice given such a languishing tenderness
to her looks, that we are told by Hamilton,
“she never opened her eyes but like a Chinese.”
In spite of all this softness, many of these women
were in the habit of swearing “good mouth-filling
oaths”&mdash;a practice thoroughly in character
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>with the general grossness of manners and language
at Charles’s court. When looking at
these portraits of the beauties, we must not think
of them all as the mistresses of the King and
Duke of York, for some remained pure in this
corrupt atmosphere. “La belle Hamilton” was
one of these, and the description both of her
mind and person by her husband, the Count de
Grammont, forms such an exquisite portrait in
words that, although well known, I venture to
transfer it to my pages:&mdash;“Miss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span> Hamilton was
at the happy age when the charms of the fair
sex begin to bloom; she had the finest shape,
the loveliest neck, and most beautiful arms in the
world; she was majestic and graceful in all her
movements; and she was the original after which
all the ladies copied in their taste and air of
dress. Her forehead was open, white, and
smooth; her hair was well set, and fell with ease
into that natural order which it is so difficult to
imitate. Her complexion was possessed of a
certain freshness, not to be equalled by borrowed
colours: her eyes were not large, but they were
lively, and capable of expressing whatever she
pleased: her mouth was full of graces, and her
contour uncommonly perfect: nor was her nose,
which was small, delicate, and turned up, the
least ornament of so lovely a face. In fine, her
air, her carriage, and the numberless graces dispersed
over her whole person, made the Chevalier
de Grammont not doubt but that she was
possessed of every other qualification. Her
mind was a proper companion for such a form:
she did not endeavour to shine in conversation
by those sprightly sallies which only puzzle; and
with still greater care she avoided that affected
solemnity in her discourse, which produces stupidity;
but without any eagerness to talk, she
just said what she ought, and no more. She had
an admirable discernment in distinguishing between
solid and false wit; and far from making
an ostentatious display of her abilities, she was
reserved, though very just in her decisions: her
sentiments were always noble, and even lofty to
the highest extent, when there was occasion;
nevertheless, she was less prepossessed with her
own merit than is usually the case with those who
have so much. Formed as we have described,
she could not fail of commanding love; but so
far was she from courting it, that she was scrupulously
nice with respect to those whose merit
might entitle them to form any pretensions to
her.”</p>

<p>On the 25th of July, 1666, Pepys went to
Whitehall to see the King at dinner, and thought
how little he should care to have people crowding
about him as they were round his Majesty.
He adds, “Among other things it astonished me
to see my Lord Barkeshire waiting at table, and
serving the King drink, in that dirty pickle as I
never saw man in my life.”</p>

<p>There is a good story told of Grammont which
is <i>apropos</i> of the above. One day, when the
King dined in state, he made the Count remark
that he was served upon the knee, a mark of
respect not common at other courts. “I thank
your Majesty for the explanation,” answered
Grammont; <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>“I thought they were begging pardon
for giving you so bad a dinner.”</p>

<p>I have already remarked on the poverty that
went hand-in-hand with extravagance, and this
is well illustrated by one or two entries in the
“<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>.” In April, 1667,<a name="Anchor_246" id="Anchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 246.">[246]</a> the King was vexed
to find no paper laid for him at the Council table.
Sir Richard Browne called Wooly, the person
who provided the paper, to explain the reason
of the neglect. He told his Majesty that he
was but a poor man, and was already out of
pocket <abbr title="400 pounds"><i>£</i>400</abbr> or <abbr title="500, pounds"><i>£</i>500,</abbr> which was as much as he
was worth; and that he could not provide it any
longer without money, not having received a
penny since the King’s coming in. Evelyn corroborated
this, and told Pepys that several of the
menial servants of the court lacked bread, and
had not received a farthing of wages since the
Restoration.<a name="Anchor_247" id="Anchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 247.">[247]</a></p>

<p>Shortly afterwards the King was found to want
personal linen, and Mr. Ashburnham, one of the
Grooms of the Bedchamber, rated the wardrobe-man
very severely for this neglect. Mr. Townsend
pleaded that he wanted money, and owed
the linendraper <abbr title="5,000 pounds"><i>£</i>5,000</abbr>. He further told Pepys
that the grooms took away the King’s linen at
the end of the quarter as their fee, whether he
could get more or not.<a name="Anchor_248" id="Anchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 248.">[248]</a> Hence the great want.</p>

<p>Charles <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> was one of the most worthless of
our monarchs, and the most beloved. The responsibility
of all evils, troubles, or crimes, was
laid upon his advisers, his mistresses, and anyone
but upon himself, by his loving subjects.
His readiness of access, and good-humoured
freedom of manner charmed all who came in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
contact with him. “Unthinkingness” was said
by Halifax to be one of his characteristics, and
Rochester uses the expression, “Unthinking
Charles;” yet this was more an apparent than a
real characteristic. Like most indolent men, he
tried to get his own way, and he was one of the
earliest to find out that if the people are allowed
their way when they are in earnest, they will let
their governors do as they wish at other times.
It has been said that the strongest resolve he
ever formed was a determination not to go on
his travels again; therefore he never opposed a
strong popular movement. He sought, however,
every opportunity of turning the movement to
his own advantage, if there were any possibility
of doing so.</p>

<p>Charles was fit to be the head of his court,
for he was among the wittiest there. He was a
good teller of a story, and fond of exhibiting his
talent. Walpole proposed to make a collection
of his witty sayings, and Peter Cunningham
carried out this idea in “<cite class="plain">The Story of Nell
Gwyn</cite>.”</p>

<p>Curiously enough, Pepys held a very poor
opinion of the King’s power in this respect.
On one occasion he says Charles’s stories were
good, although “he tells them but meanly.”<a name="Anchor_249" id="Anchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 249.">[249]</a>
At another time he alludes to “the silly discourse
of the King.”<a name="Anchor_250" id="Anchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 250.">[250]</a></p>

<p>The Diarist must surely have been prejudiced,
for the general opinion on this point, and
the stories that have come down to us, are
against him. That was a happy distinction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
made by Charles when he said of Godolphin,
then a page at court, that he was never <em>in</em> the
way, and never <em>out</em> of the way. Of the King’s
natural abilities there can be no doubt. He took
an intelligent interest in the formation of the
Royal Society, and passed many hours in his
own laboratory. Pepys visited this place on
January 15th, 1668–69, and was much pleased
with it. He saw there “a great many chymical
glasses and things, but understood none of
them.”</p>

<p>The King was fond of seeing and making
dissections,<a name="Anchor_251" id="Anchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 251.">[251]</a> and the very month he died he was
engaged in some experiments on the production
of mercury.</p>

<p>His greatest fault was want of faith, for he
believed neither in the honour of man nor the
virtue of woman; and, as a consequence, he lived
down to his debased views. His religion always
sat lightly upon him, but such as it was it
was not that of a Protestant. James <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> told
Pepys, in a private conversation, that Charles
had been a Roman Catholic some long time
before his death.<a name="Anchor_252" id="Anchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 252.">[252]</a></p>

<p>Charles’s relations with women were singularly
heartless. His conduct towards his wife was
abominable, although when in her company he
was usually polite. On the occasion of her
serious illness, when she was like to die, he conjured
her to live for his sake, and Grammont
hints that he was disappointed when she took
him at his word.</p>

<p>The Queen, although not beautiful, was pleasing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
in appearance, and the King appears to have
been satisfied with her when she arrived in
England, for he wrote to Clarendon, that her
eyes were excellent and her voice agreeable,
adding, “If I have any skill in physiognomy,
which I think I have, she must be as good a
woman as ever was born.” A few days after he
wrote to the Chancellor in these words, “My
brother will tell you of all that passes here,
which I hope will be to your satisfaction. I am
sure ’tis so much to mine that I cannot easily
tell you how happy I think myself, and I must
be the worst man living (which I hope I am
not) if I be not a good husband. I am confident
never two humors were better fitted together
than ours are.”<a name="Anchor_253" id="Anchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 253.">[253]</a> Yet shortly after writing
thus, he thrust his abandoned mistress, Lady
Castlemaine, upon this virtuous wife; so that
from his own mouth we can condemn him.
Pepys reports a sharp answer (“a wipe,” he calls
it) which the Queen made to the favourite.
Lady Castlemaine came in and found the Queen
under the dresser’s hand, which she had been for
a long time. “I wonder your Majesty,” says she,
“can have the patience to sit so long adressing?”&mdash;“I
have so much reason to use patience,” says
the Queen, “that I can very well bear with it.”<a name="Anchor_254" id="Anchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 254.">[254]</a></p>

<p>Clarendon was charged with choosing Katherine
because he knew that she could not bear
children to the King, but this was a most foul
calumny. She was naturally most anxious to be
a mother, and in her delirium she fancied that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>she had given birth to a boy, but was troubled
because he was ugly. The King, being by, said,
“No, it is a very pretty boy.” “Nay,” says
she, “if it be like you it is a fine boy indeed, and
I would be very well pleased with it.”<a name="Anchor_255" id="Anchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 255.">[255]</a></p>

<p>The Duke of York was pre-eminently a man
of business, and there remains little to be added
here to what has been already said in the
<a href="#Ref_Chapter_VIII" title="Go to reference">chapter on the Navy</a>. He did not shine at
Court, and his conduct there is amusingly described
in the Grammont “Memoirs,” <i>apropos</i>
of his fancy for “la belle Hamilton:”&mdash;“As hunting
was his favourite diversion, that sport employed
him one part of the day, and he came
home generally much fatigued; but Miss Hamilton’s
presence revived him, when he found
her either with the Queen or the Duchess. There
it was that, not daring to tell her what lay heavy
on his heart, he entertained her with what he
had in his head: telling her miracles of the
cunning of foxes and the mettle of horses;
giving her accounts of broken legs and arms,
dislocated shoulders and other curious and entertaining
adventures; after which, his eyes told
her the rest, till such time as sleep interrupted
their conversation; for these tender interpreters
could not help sometimes composing themselves
in the midst of their ogling.”</p>

<p>It is not necessary to enter fully into the
history of the Duke’s amours, but one curious incident
in his life may be noticed here. In the year
1673 he had a passion for Susan, Lady Bellasys,
widow of Sir Henry Bellasys, K.B. (who fell in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>foolish duel with Tom Porter,<a name="Anchor_256" id="Anchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 256.">[256]</a>), and, although she
was a Protestant, he gave her a promise of marriage,
after having tried in vain to convert her to
the Roman Catholic faith. When her father-in-law,
John, Lord Bellasys, who was a Roman Catholic,
heard of this, he, fearing that she would convert
the Duke, and thus spoil all hope of introducing
the Roman Catholic religion into England, went
to the King and told him of his brother’s matrimonial
intentions. Charles thereupon prohibited
the marriage.<a name="Anchor_257" id="Anchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 257.">[257]</a></p>

<p>After James came to the throne, his daughter
Mary, Princess of Orange, expressed a desire
through <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur d’Alberville</span> to know the chief
motives of his conversion; and in reply he wrote
her a full account of the circumstances that led
to it. He tells her that he was bred a strict
Church of England man, “And I was so zealous
that way, that when the Queen my mother designed
to bring up my brother, the Duke of
Gloucester, a Catholic, I, preserving still the
respect due to her, did my part to keep him
steady to his first principles; and, as young
people often do, I made it a point of honour to
stick to what we had been educated in, without
examining whether we were right or wrong.”<a name="Anchor_258" id="Anchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 258.">[258]</a></p>

<p>Anne Hyde, then in the household of the
Princess of Orange, was contracted to the Duke
of York on November 24th, 1659, and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
secretly married to him at Worcester House, on
September 3rd, 1660. There is a good story
told by Locke, in his “<cite class="plain">Memoirs of Lord Shaftesbury</cite>,”
which shows how shrewd that nobleman
was: “Soon after the Restoration the Earl of
Southampton and Sir Anthony Ashley Cooper,
having dined together at the Chancellor’s, as
they were returning home Sir Anthony said to
my Lord Southampton, ‘Yonder Mrs. Anne
Hyde is certainly married to one of the Brothers.’
The Earl, who was a friend to the Chancellor,
treated this as a chimæra, and asked him how
so wild a fancy could get into his head. ‘Assure
yourself’ (replied he) ‘it is so. A concealed
respect (however suppressed) showed itself
so plainly in the looks, voice, and manner
wherewith her mother carved to her, or offered
her of every dish, that it is impossible but it
must be so.’ My Lord Southampton, who
thought it a groundless conceit then, was not
long after convinced, by the Duke of York’s
owning her, that Lord Ashley was no bad
guesser.”<a name="Anchor_259" id="Anchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 259.">[259]</a></p>

<p>An infamous conspiracy was formed by Sir
Charles Berkeley and others to induce the Duke
to deny his marriage by accusing his wife of
immoral conduct. Although the Duke in the
end acted honourably by her, he did not dismiss
the miscreants who lied in the basest manner.
There seems reason to believe that a few years
afterwards she did carry on an intrigue with
Henry Sidney, afterwards Earl of Romney, and
Pepys alludes to the rumours respecting this on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>November 17th, 1665, January 9th, 1665–6, and
October 15th, 1666. Peter Cunningham sums
up the evidence on the point as follows:&mdash;“There
cannot, I think, be any doubt of the intrigue
of the Duchess of York (Anne Hyde)
with Harry Sidney, afterwards Earl of Romney,
brother of Algernon Sidney and of Waller’s
Sacharissa. See on what testimony it rests.
Hamilton more than hints at it; Burnet is very
pointed about it in his History; Reresby just
mentions and Pepys refers to it in three distinct
entries and on three different authorities.”<a name="Anchor_260" id="Anchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 260.">[260]</a></p>

<p>Pepys tells us that the Duchess sat at her husband’s
council, and interfered with business,<a name="Anchor_261" id="Anchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 261.">[261]</a> and
the fact that she was the master was generally acknowledged.
On one occasion the King called
his brother “Tom Otter,” alluding to the henpecked
husband in Ben Jonson’s “Epicene, or
the Silent Woman.” Tom Killegrew threw the
sarcasm back upon the King with telling effect,
by saying, “Sir, pray which is the best for a
man to be, a Tom Otter to his wife or to his
mistress?”<a name="Anchor_262" id="Anchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 262.">[262]</a> it being well known that Charles
was the slave of Lady Castlemaine.</p>

<div class="figcenter gap_above">
    <a name="barbara_villers" id="barbara_villers" title="Barbara Villiers, Duchess of Cleveland" class="noline"><img width="454" height="600" src="images/barbara.jpg" alt="Barbara Villiers, Duchess of Cleveland" /></a>
</div>

<p>The Duchess possessed great abilities, and
readily adapted herself to her exalted position.
Burnet says of her that she <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>“was a very extraordinary
woman. She had great knowledge,
and a lively sense of things. She understood
what belonged to a princess, and took state
upon her rather too much.”</p>

<p>The next personage of importance at court
was Mrs. Palmer, afterwards Countess of Castlemaine
and Duchess of Cleveland, who figures so
largely in the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>.” It is greatly to the
credit of Lords Clarendon and Southampton
that they would have nothing to do with the
King’s favourite. Burnet tells us that the former
would let nothing pass the Great Seal in which
she was named, and the latter would never suffer
her name to appear in the Treasury books. The
King usually held a court at his mistress’s
lodgings before going to church, and his ministers
made their applications there, but Clarendon
and Southampton were never to be seen in her
rooms.</p>

<p>Clarendon opposed her admission to the post
of Lady of the Bedchamber to the Queen, and
would not allow his wife to visit her; in consequence
he made an implacable enemy who did
not rest until she had compassed his disgrace.</p>

<p>On July 26th, 1662, Pepys heard that when
the mistress’s name was presented by the King
to his wife, the Queen pricked it out of the list.
On February 23rd, 1662–63, he heard that the
King had given to Lady Castlemaine all the
Christmas presents made him by the peers; and
that at a court ball she was much richer in
jewels than the Queen and Duchess both together.
Although our Diarist was a devoted
admirer of the lady, he is forced to call this <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>“a
most abominable thing.”</p>

<p>Lady Castlemaine was a woman of the most
abandoned profligacy, and, moreover, of bad
manners as well as bad morals. In the Grammont
“Memoirs” she is described as “disagreeable
from the unpolished state of her
manners, her ill-timed pride, her uneven temper
and extravagant humours.” Pepys knew her
only in the distance, and was infatuated with
her beauty; at one time he fills his eyes with
her, which much pleases him,<a name="Anchor_263" id="Anchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 263.">[263]</a> and at another
he “gluts himself with looking at her.”<a name="Anchor_264" id="Anchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 264.">[264]</a> The
sight of her at any public place was quite sufficient
to give him pleasure, whatever the entertainment
might be, and his admiration was
extended to everything which was in any way
connected with the King’s mistress.</p>

<p>The greatest beauty at the court of Charles <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr>
was Frances Stuart, who was most assiduously
followed by the King. She was the exact opposite
of Lady Castlemaine, being as much a
lady as her rival was ill-mannered, and as foolish
as the other was clever. Her portrait is
admirably painted in the Grammont “Memoirs,”
thus:&mdash;“She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span> was childish in her behaviour and
laughed at everything, and her taste for frivolous
amusements, though unaffected, was only
allowable in a girl about twelve or thirteen years
old. A child however she was in every other
respect, except playing with a doll: blind man’s
buff was her most favourite amusement: she
was building castles of cards, while the deepest
play was going on in her apartments, where you
saw her surrounded by eager courtiers, who
handed her the cards, or young architects, who
endeavoured to imitate her.”</p>

<div class="figcenter gap_above">
    <a name="frances_stuart" id="frances_stuart" title="Frances Stuart, Duchess of Richmond" class="noline"><img width="454" height="600" src="images/frances_stuart.jpg" alt="Frances Stuart, Duchess of Richmond" /></a>
</div>

<p>Her relations with the King were of a very
risky character, and scandal made very free with
her good fame. Pepys took it for granted after
hearing the common report that she was the
King’s mistress;<a name="Anchor_265" id="Anchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 265.">[265]</a> yet Evelyn told him on April
26th, 1667, that up to the time of her leaving
the court to be married there was not a more
virtuous woman in the world. A passage in
the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>” (<abbr title="November">Nov.</abbr> 6th, 1663) exhibits very
strongly the low state of morality at court.
Lord Sandwich told Pepys “how he and Sir H.
Bennet, the Duke of Buckingham and his
Duchess, was of a committee with somebody
else for the getting of Mrs. Stewart for the
King, but that she proves a cunning slut, and is
advised at Somerset House by the Queen mother,
and by her mother, and so all the plot is spoiled
and the whole committee broke.” By the early
part of the year 1667 Mrs. Stewart’s position
had become quite untenable, and to escape from
the King’s importunities she accepted the proposal
of marriage made to her by the Duke of
Richmond. The King threw all the obstacles
he could in the way of the marriage, and when
the lovers escaped and were united he exhibited
the greatest chagrin. Pepys relates a story<a name="Anchor_266" id="Anchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 266.">[266]</a> that
Charles one Sunday night took a pair of oars
and rowed secretly to Somerset House in order
to get sight of the Duchess, who was then living
there. The garden door not being open, he is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>said to have clambered over the wall, “which
is a horrid shame!”</p>

<p>The Duke was afterwards appointed ambassador
to Denmark, and died at Elsinore, December
21st, 1672. After the death of her husband
the Duchess lived at court and attached herself
to the person of the Queen. In the latter years
of her life she remained in seclusion dividing
her time between cards and cats. She died in
1702, and by her last will left several favourite
cats to different female friends with legacies for
their support.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>Among the lesser lights of the court was
Elizabeth, Countess of Chesterfield, who figures
so prominently in the Grammont “Memoirs.”
The scandal there related did not escape the
open ears of Pepys, who on the 3rd of November,
1662, first hears that the Duke of York is
smitten with the lady; that the Duchess has
complained to the King, and that the Countess
has gone into the country. The Earl is not
mentioned here, but on January 19th, 1662–3,
the Diarist obtained fuller particulars, and learnt
that Lord Chesterfield had long been jealous of
the Duke. Pepys calls the Countess “a most
good virtuous woman,” and evidently considers
the husband’s conduct in carrying off his wife
to his seat in Derbyshire as caused by a fit of
ungrounded jealousy. The day after Lord
Chesterfield had seen his wife talking with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>Duke of York, he went to tell the latter how
much he felt wronged, but the Duke answered
with calmness, and pretended not to understand
the reason of complaint. The story of the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bas verds</i> that forms so prominent a feature in
the Grammont account is not alluded to by the
Diarist, but these brilliant coloured stockings
introduced by the Countess, seem to have become
fashionable subsequently, for on the 15th
of February, 1668–9, Pepys bought a pair of
green silk stockings, garters, and shoe-strings,
and two pairs of jessimy gloves to present to
his valentine.</p>

<p>The career of pretty Margaret Brook, who
married Sir John Denham on the 25th of May,
1665, was a short one. On the 10th of June,
1666, Pepys hears that she has become the Duke
of York’s new mistress, and that she declares she
will be owned publicly. On November 12th of
the same year he hears of her serious illness, an
illness that terminated in death.</p>

<p>At this time rumours of poisoning were easily
put into circulation, and some supposed that
Lady Denham was murdered by her husband.
Others whispered that the Duchess of York
had poisoned her with powder of diamonds, but
when her body was opened after death, as she
had desired it should be, no sign of poison was
found.<a name="Anchor_268" id="Anchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 268.">[268]</a></p>

<p>One of the most brilliant of the maids of
honour, and, to her credit be it said, one of the
few virtuous ladies at court, was Frances Jennings,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
the eldest sister of Sarah, afterwards
Duchess of Marlborough. The Duke made
advances to her, which she repulsed coolly.
He could not believe in his defeat, and plied
her with love-letters. It was not etiquette for
her to return them to him, so she affected unconsciousness,
and carelessly drawing out her
handkerchief allowed these royal effusions to
fall upon the floor for anyone who chose to pick
up. The King now laid siege to the beauty,
but was equally unsuccessful as his brother had
been. In the Grammont “Memoirs” there is
a full account of the lady’s freaks, and Pepys
managed to hear of one of them:&mdash;“<a name="Ref_Mrs_Jennings" id="Ref_Mrs_Jennings" class="noline">Mrs. Jennings</a>,
one of the Duchess’s maids, the other day
dressed herself like an orange wench, and went
up and down, and cried oranges; till falling
down, or by some accident, her fine shoes were
discerned, and she put to a great deal of shame.”<a name="Anchor_269" id="Anchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 269.">[269]</a>
This is but a bald account of the adventure so
graphically described by Hamilton, who makes
the object of Miss Jennings’s disguise to be a
visit to the famous German doctor and astrologer
in Tower Street. Rochester assumed this
character and the name of Alexander Bendo at
the same time, issuing a bill in which he detailed
his cures, and announced his powers of prophecy.
This was on the occasion of one of the wild
young Lord’s escapes from court, but we are
not told its date. Hamilton is silent on this
point, but Pepys’s corroboration of one part of
the adventure helps to date the other.</p>

<p>Frances Jennings was loved by the dashing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>Dick Talbot, who was accounted the finest figure
and the tallest man in the kingdom, but she
offended him by her partiality for the lady-killer
Jermyn. She was soon disgusted by this empty
coxcomb, and in 1665 was married to George
Hamilton, brother of the author of the Grammont
“Memoirs.” After the death of Hamilton,
the widow married her first lover Talbot, afterwards
created Duke of Tyrconnel. Subsequent
to the death of her second husband, she
visited London, and hired a stall at the New
Exchange in the Strand, where, dressed in a
white robe and masked with a white domino,
she maintained herself for a time by the sale of
small articles of haberdashery. Thus her second
and more notorious adventure caused her to be
known as the “White Milliner.”</p>

<p>This notice of the ladies of the Court of
Charles <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> may be concluded with a brief mention
of the two actresses,&mdash;Nell Gwyn and
Moll Davis.</p>

<p>Pepys’s first mention of the former is under
date April 3rd, 1665, where he calls her “pretty
witty Nell.” He was always delighted to see
her, and constantly praises her excellent acting,
yet sometimes he finds fault, for instance&mdash;“Nell’s
ill-speaking of a great part made me
mad.”<a name="Anchor_270" id="Anchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 270.">[270]</a> She disliked acting serious parts, and
with reason, for she spoilt them.<a name="Anchor_271" id="Anchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 271.">[271]</a> Pepys mentions
on January 11th, 1667–68, that the King
had sent several times for Nell, but it was not
until some time after that she left the stage finally,
and became a recognized mistress of the King.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>Peter Cunningham tells us, in his “<cite class="plain">Story of Nell
Gwyn</cite>,” that had the King lived she would have
been created Countess of Greenwich. James <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr>
attended to his brother’s dying wish: “Do not
let poor Nelly starve,” and when she was outlawed
for debt he paid her debts. Her life was not
a long one, and she died of apoplexy in November,
1687, in the thirty-eighth year of her age.</p>

<p>Moll Davis it is well known charmed the King
by her singing of the song, “My lodging is on
the cold ground,” in the character of the shepherdess
Celania in Davenant’s “Rivals,” a play
altered from “The Two Noble Kinsmen,” and
the Duke of Buckingham is said to have encouraged
the King’s passion for her in order to
spite the Countess of Castlemaine. She was
also a fine dancer, and greatly pleased Pepys on
more than one occasion. On March 7th, 1666–67,
he expresses the opinion that her dancing
of a jig in boy’s clothes was infinitely better
than that of Nell Gwyn. About a year after
this, when Moll Davis had been “raised” to
the position of King’s mistress, she danced a jig
at court; and the Queen being at this public
exhibition of one of her rivals in her own palace,
got up and left the theatre.<a name="Anchor_272" id="Anchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 272.">[272]</a></p>

<p>After the ladies come the male courtiers, but
these butterflies of the court do not figure very
prominently in the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>.” Rochester is occasionally
mentioned, as is Henry Jermyn rather
oftener. Buckingham appears more frequently,
but then he set up for a statesman. He was
one of the most hateful characters in history,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>and as one reads in the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>” the record of
his various actions, the feelings of disgust and
loathing that they inspire are near akin to hatred.
He gave counsel to the King at which Charles
recoiled; he showed himself a coward in his relations
with Lord Ossory, and his conduct towards
his wife proves that he was not even a
gentleman. Grammont calls Buckingham a fool,
but he was more of a knave than a fool, for he
was too clever for us to be able to despise him.
He seems to have exerted the fascination of the
serpent over those around him, and the four
masterly hands that have drawn his portrait evidently
thought it worthy the devotion of their
greatest care. Walpole says of these four famous
portraits: “Burnet has hewn it out with his
rough chisel; Count Hamilton touched it with
that slight delicacy that finishes while it seems
but to sketch; Dryden caught the living likeness;
Pope completed the historical resemblance.”<a name="Anchor_273" id="Anchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 273.">[273]</a></p>

<p>In conclusion, some mention must be made of
those who did not take a prominent position at
court, but who nevertheless exerted considerable
influence in that corrupted circle, such as
the Chiffinches, Bab May, and Edward Progers,
with all of whom Pepys had constant communication.
Thomas Chiffinch was one of the pages
of the King’s bedchamber, and keeper of his
private closet. He died in 1666, and was succeeded
in his employments by his brother
William, who became a still greater favourite of
the King than Thomas, and was the receiver of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>the secret pensions paid by the court of France to
the King of England. Progers had been banished
from Charles’s presence in 1650, by an Act of
the Estates of Scotland, “as an evil instrument
and bad counseller of the King.” Baptist May,
Keeper of the Privy Purse, had a still worse rebuff
than this, for when he went down in state
as the court candidate for Winchelsea, he was
rejected by the people, who cried out that they
would have “No court pimp to be their burgess.”<a name="Anchor_274" id="Anchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 274.">[274]</a>
It would not be fair, however, to throw
all the obloquy upon these understrappers, for
we have already seen that the bearers of historical
names could lend themselves to perform
the same duties.</p>

<p class="drop-cap noindent full"><span class="upper-case">In</span> dealing with the public characters
at the time of the Restoration, the
two men who were mainly instrumental
in bringing that event about&mdash;Monk
and Montagu&mdash;must needs
be given a prominent place.</p>

<p>George Monk, Duke of Albemarle, was a singularly
unheroic character. He was slow and
heavy, but had a sufficient supply of good sense,
and, in spite of many faults, he had the rare
good fortune to be generally loved.<a name="Anchor_275" id="Anchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 275.">[275]</a> He was so
popular that ballads were continually being made
in his praise. Pepys said there were so many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
of them that in after times his fame would sound
like that of Guy of Warwick.<a name="Anchor_276" id="Anchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 276.">[276]</a></p>

<p>Aubrey tells us that Monk learned his trade of
soldiering in the Low Countries, whence he fled
after having slain a man. Although he frequently
went to sea in command of the fleet, he
always remained a soldier, and the seamen
laughed behind his back when instead of crying
“Tack about,” he would say “Wheel to the
right or left.” Pepys tells a story of him to the
same effect: “It was pretty to hear the Duke
of Albemarle himself to wish that they would
come on our ground, meaning the French, for
that he would pay them, so as to make them
glad to go back to France again; <em>which was
like a general, but not like an admiral</em>.”<a name="Anchor_277" id="Anchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 277.">[277]</a></p>

<p>Monk was fond of low company; both he
and his vulgar wife were quite unfit for high&mdash;I
cannot say refined&mdash;society, for there was but
little refinement at court. Ann Clarges had
been kind to Monk when he was a prisoner in
the Tower, and he married her out of gratitude.
She had been previously married to Thomas
Ratford, of whose death no notice was given at
the time of the marriage, so that the legitimacy
of Christopher, afterwards second Duke of Albemarle,
was seriously questioned. Aubrey relates
a story which cannot well be true, but which
proves the general feeling of doubt respecting
the point. He says that Thomas Clarges came
on shipboard to tell Monk that his sister had
had a child. Monk cried out, “What is it?”
and on hearing the answer, “A boy,” he said,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>“Why, then, she is my wife.” Pepys was told a
tale by Mr. Cooling which corroborates the
opinion expressed on the company kept by the
Duke. “Once the Duke of Albemarle, in his
drink, taking notice as of a wonder that Nan
Hide should ever come to be Duchess of York.
‘Nay,’ says Troutbeck, ‘ne’er wonder at that;
for if you will give me another bottle of wine, I
will tell you as great, if not a greater miracle.’
And what was that, but that our dirty Bess
(meaning his Duchess) should come to be
Duchess of Albemarle?”<a name="Anchor_278" id="Anchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 278.">[278]</a></p>

<p>Sir Edward Montagu, Earl of Sandwich,
was in every respect the opposite of Monk. He
was a courtier and a gentleman, but he did not
manage to gain the popularity of his great contemporary,
nor to retain such as he did at one
time possess. As Pepys’s great patron his name
naturally occupies a very prominent position in
the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>,” and as such he has already been
frequently alluded to in these pages. He appears
to have been a very agreeable man, but so
easy and careless in business matters that he
was continually in want of money. In 1662
Pepys found that he was above <abbr title="7,000 pounds"><i>£</i>7,000</abbr> in debt,
and his enemies soon after gave out that his
debts amounted to <abbr title="100,000 pounds"><i>£</i>100,000</abbr>. At any rate, his
finances were so often in an unsatisfactory state
that Pepys had a special dislike to lending his
money in that quarter. Three years afterwards
he had grown very unpopular, and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>“it was purposed
by some hot-heads in the House of Commons,
at the same time when they voted a present
to the Duke of York, to have voted <abbr title="10,000 pounds"><i>£</i>10,000</abbr>
to the Prince, and <em>half-a-crown</em> to my Lord of
Sandwich; but nothing came of it.”<a name="Anchor_279" id="Anchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 279.">[279]</a> It was,
therefore, well for him when he obtained an
honourable exile by being appointed ambassador
to the court of Spain, as there he was held in
high esteem. His enemies, however, were not
satisfied, and they continued to attack him during
his absence. Whatever his faults, and they were
probably many, Lord Sandwich was by far the
most able naval commander of his time, so that
the nation had a heavy loss when he was killed
in the naval action against the Dutch at Solebay,
in May, 1672.</p>

<p>Prince Rupert, as the cousin of the King, naturally
held a prominent position in the State,
but he did not gain much credit from the undertakings
he was thrust into. His fame as a brilliant,
though rash, soldier, was gained during the
troubles of his uncle’s reign, and not from anything
he did after the Restoration. He was out
of place on board ship, although he is said to
have displayed immense bravery and much skill
in the sea-fight against the Dutch, from August
11th to 13th, 1673. His interest in science and
mechanical art appears to have been real, and to
him we owe the invention or introduction into
England of mezzotinto engraving, and the introduction
of</p>

<p>The Prince’s courage was so patent to all that
his friends were rather surprised to find that when
he was very ill and like to die, “he had no more
mind to it than another man;” so they came to
the rather lame conclusion that “courage is not
what men take it to be&mdash;a contempt of death.”<a name="Anchor_280" id="Anchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 280.">[280]</a></p>

    <p class="caption">EDWARD HYDE, EARL OF CLARENDON.</p>
</div>

<p>The next great public character was Edward
Hyde, Earl of Clarendon, who for the few years
before his fall was the greatest man in the kingdom.
Public opinion has been much divided as to
his merits. In spite of many very evident faults,
he certainly exhibited on several occasions a high-minded
spirit. He would not consent to do any
business with the King’s mistresses, and Burnet
says that he “kept a register of all the King’s
promises, and of his own, and did all that lay in
his power afterwards to get them performed.”
His disposition was rather ungracious, and he
made many enemies, who attacked him with success
when the King was tired of him. Clarendon
was very dictatorial with Charles, and sent him
such missives as this, “I pray be at Worcester
House on Sunday as soon as may be.” On one
occasion he fixed eight o’clock in the morning,
for Lord Broghill to have an audience with the
King, who did not think the arrangement quite
fair, and wrote, “You give appointments in a
morning to others sooner than you take them
yourself, but if my Lord Broghill will come at
nine, he shall be welcome.”</p>

<p>On the institution of the Royal Society, Lord
Clarendon was appointed visitor for life, but
after his death the position was to be held by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
several high officers, by reason of their offices.
Sprat, in his “History of the Royal Society,”
specially thanks the Lord Chancellor, Attorney-General,
and Solicitor-General, for their assistance
in the preparation of the charter; a proof,
says Sprat, of the falsehood of the reproach that
law is an enemy to learning and civil arts.</p>

<p>One day in July, 1664, Lord Sandwich told
Pepys that Lord Clarendon was very displeased
with him for being forward in the cutting down
of trees in Clarendon Park; so the Diarist sought
an interview with the Lord Chancellor in order
that he might soothe the great man, and he was
successful in his endeavour.<a name="Anchor_281" id="Anchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 281.">[281]</a></p>

<p>Clarendon Park, near Salisbury, was crown-land
mortgaged by Charles <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr> for <abbr title="20,000 pounds"><i>£</i>20,000</abbr>, and
granted by Charles <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> to the Duke of Albemarle
subject to this mortgage, and with the
right to the timber reserved to the Crown. Lord
Clarendon bought the place of Albemarle, and
his complaint against the Commissioners of the
Navy was, that while they had all the royal
forests at command, they chose to spoil the beauty
of his property. He further affirmed that he had
no intention to contest the King’s right, nor to
defraud the Crown of timber; but complained
that at the very time the Commissioners sent
down a person to mark standing timber for felling,
there was a large quantity of wood belonging
to the Crown lying on the estate unappropriated,
which had been “felled divers years” before.<a name="Anchor_282" id="Anchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 282.">[282]</a></p>

<p>Two of Pepys’s patrons&mdash;Sir George Downing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
and Sir William Coventry&mdash;are frequently
mentioned in the “Diary;” the first almost always
with some expression of dislike, and the
other invariably in terms of respect. He sometimes
describes his whilom master as “a stingy
fellow,”<a name="Anchor_283" id="Anchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 283.">[283]</a> and laughs at his ridiculous pieces of
thrift, “and niggardly manner of entertaining his
poor neighbours.”<a name="Anchor_284" id="Anchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 284.">[284]</a> At another time he calls him
“a perfidious rogue” for betraying former friends;<a name="Anchor_285" id="Anchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 285.">[285]</a>
still, he could appreciate Downing’s business
capabilities, and when setting down the fact that
the Commissioners of the Treasury had chosen
Sir G. Downing for their secretary, he added, “I
think, in my conscience, they have done a great
thing in it, for he is active and a man of business,
and values himself upon having of things do
well under his hand; so that I am mightily
pleased in their choice.”<a name="Anchor_286" id="Anchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 286.">[286]</a> At this time Pepys
had forgotten the constant causes of annoyance
which Downing had given him, and he could
afford to be magnanimous in acknowledging his
enemy’s good qualities. I have already remarked
that Sir William Coventry stands out
prominently as the only person who is noticed
in the “<cite>Diary</cite>” in terms of unqualified praise.
Other men of the time did not equally admire
him, so that it is not easy to come to a just
estimation of his character.</p>

<p>Poor Pepys was placed in an awkward predicament
on one occasion when he was on a visit
to Hampton Court, owing to the enmity between
Coventry and Lord Sandwich. He was pleased
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>when the latter asked him to come privately to
his lodgings, but adds, “Lord! to see in what
difficulty I stand, that I dare not walk with Sir
W. Coventry for fear my Lord or Sir G. Carteret
should see me; nor with either of them, for fear
Sir W. Coventry should.”<a name="Anchor_287" id="Anchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 287.">[287]</a></p>

<p>When Clarendon fell, in 1667, it was thought
likely that Coventry would succeed him as
virtual prime minister. His quarrel, however,
with the Duke of Buckingham put him out
of favour with the King and out of office; so
that, although he survived until 1686, he never
again took a prominent part in political affairs.</p>

<p>Arthur Annesley, afterwards Earl of Anglesey,
is called by Pepys “a grave, serious man,”<a name="Anchor_288" id="Anchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 288.">[288]</a>
and “a very notable man,”<a name="Anchor_289" id="Anchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 289.">[289]</a> but he does not
appear to have been a very friendly one. Although
he was under obligations to Sir Edward
Montagu’s family, he took the opportunity, when
the thanks of Parliament were voted to Montagu,
to quash the motion which was made to give
him a reward.<a name="Anchor_290" id="Anchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 290.">[290]</a> He was made Treasurer of
the Navy in 1667, in succession to Sir George
Carteret, and in the following year when he
answered the Duke of York’s letter, he bid the
Duke call for Pepys’s books,<a name="Anchor_291" id="Anchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 291.">[291]</a> in hopes that the
Clerk of the Acts might get a reprimand. A
peace seems afterwards to have subsisted between
the two, for in 1672 Lord Anglesey signed
himself in a letter to Pepys, “Your affectionate
friend and servant.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>Sir Thomas Osborne, subsequently Viscount
Dunblane, Earl of Danby, Marquis of Carmarthen,
and Duke of Leeds, was appointed
joint Treasurer of the Navy, with Sir Thomas
Littleton, to succeed Lord Anglesey. This appointment
was greatly disliked by the Duke of
York and the officers of the navy, who looked
upon the two men as spies set to watch them.
Pepys calls Osborne a creature of the Duke of
Buckingham’s,<a name="Anchor_292" id="Anchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 292.">[292]</a> and at another time says he is
a beggar “having <abbr title="11 or 12 hundred"><i>£</i>11 or <i>£</i>12,00</abbr> a year, but
owes about <abbr title="10,000 pounds"><i>£</i>10,000</abbr>.”<a name="Anchor_293" id="Anchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 293.">[293]</a> It is clear that the Diarist
did not foresee the great figure Osborne was
about to make in the world; a rise somewhat
due to his own parts, and much to the favour of
the King. When Charles made him Lord High
Treasurer, he told him that he ought to take
care of himself, for he had but two friends in
England. This startled Osborne, until his
majesty explained himself by saying that he
(the King) was one, and the other was the
Treasurer’s merits.<a name="Anchor_294" id="Anchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 294.">[294]</a></p>

<p>Joseph Williamson, who rose from a college
tutorship to the office of Secretary of State, has
a few words of praise given to him in the
“<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>.” He was the son of a clergyman, and
in early life is said to have acted as secretary to
a member of parliament. He graduated at
Oxford as a member of Queen’s College, and
in December, 1661, was appointed Keeper of
the State Paper Office. About the same time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>he was Latin Secretary to the King, an office
the reversion of which had been promised to
John Evelyn. In 1666 Williamson undertook
the superintendence of the “London Gazette,”
and in 1672 obtained the post of Clerk to the
Privy Council, on the resignation of Sir Richard
Browne, when he was knighted. The King had
many years before promised to give the place
to Evelyn, but in consideration of the renewal
of the lease of Sayes Court, the latter parted
with it to Williamson. Honours now came
thick upon the new-made knight. He was
Plenipotentiary at the Congress of Cologne in
1673 and 1674, and on his return to England
was made Principal Secretary of State, a position
which he held for four years. He was President
of the Royal Society in 1678, and married
Catherine Stuart, daughter of George, Lord
Aubigny, and widow of Henry O’Brien, Lord
Ibracken, eldest son of the Earl of Thomond,
in 1682. He died in 1701, and was buried in
the Duke of Richmond and Lennox’s vault in
Henry <abbr title="the Seventh">VII.</abbr>’s Chapel, by right of his wife’s
connection with the Duke of Lennox.</p>

<p>The widow’s eldest son by her first husband,
Donald O’Brien, was lost in the wreck of the
“Gloucester” in 1682, and he is mentioned in a
letter of Pepys to Hewer, written from Edinburgh
on May 8th of that year. The will of
the father contains the following very remarkable
paragraph:&mdash;“I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span> conjure my son Donatus
O’Brien, to honour and obey his King in whatever
he commands that is not contradictory to
the Holy Scripture and Protestant religion, in
which I conjure him (upon pain of my curse)
not only to continue himself, but to advise his
brothers and sisters to do the same; and that
he never marry a Papist; and that he take great
care if ever God bless him with children (which
I trust he will many) to breed them strictly in
the Protestant religion. I advise him to cherish
the English on his estate, and drive out the
Irish, and especially those of them who go
under the name of gentlemen.”<a name="Anchor_295" id="Anchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 295.">[295]</a></p>

<p>Before passing on to make a final note on
some of the celebrated sailors alluded to in the
“<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>,” a place must be found for one of the
most eccentric women that ever lived&mdash;Margaret,
Duchess of Newcastle. Pepys writes, “the
whole story of this lady is romance, and all she
does is romantic.”<a name="Anchor_296" id="Anchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 296.">[296]</a> Every one who came in
contact with her fooled her to the top of her
bent. Evelyn likened her to Zenobia, the
mother of the Gracchi, Vittoria Colonna, besides
a long line of other celebrities, and when
she “took the dust” in the park she was followed
and crowded upon by coaches all the way
she went, so that nobody could come near her.<a name="Anchor_297" id="Anchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 297.">[297]</a></p>

<p>Her husband’s play, “The Humourous
Lovers,” was, Pepys says, “the most silly thing
that ever came upon a stage,”<a name="Anchor_298" id="Anchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 298.">[298]</a> and also “the
most ridiculous thing that ever was wrote,”<a name="Anchor_299" id="Anchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 299.">[299]</a> yet
she and the Duke were “mightily pleased with
it, and she at the end made her respects to the
players from her box, and did give them thanks.”</p>

<p>On the 30th of May, 1667, the Duchess made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
a visit to one of the meetings of the Royal
Society, when various fine experiments were
shown for her entertainment. She was loud in
her expressions of admiration as she was led out
of the room by several noblemen who were
among the company present. There had been
great debate among the philosophers as to the
advisability of inviting the lady, for many believed
that the town would be full of ballads on
the event. Her footmen were habited in velvet
coats, and she herself appeared in antique dress,
so that there is no cause for wonder that people
came to see her as if she were the Queen of
Sheba. Mrs. Evelyn drew a very lively picture
of the Duchess in a letter to Dr. Bohun: “I
acknowledge, though I remember her some years
since, and have not been a stranger to her
fame, I was surprised to find so much extravagancy
and vanity in any person not confined
within four walls.... Her mien surpasses the
imagination of poets or the descriptions of
romance heroine’s greatness; her gracious bows,
seasonable nods, courteous stretching out of her
hands, twinkling of her eyes, and various gestures
of approbation, show what may be expected
from her discourse, which is airy, empty, whimsical,
and rambling as her books, aiming at
science difficulties, high notions, terminating
commonly in nonsense, oaths, and obscenity.”
Pepys’s summing up of the Duchess’s character
is shorter, but accords well with Mrs. Evelyn’s
opinion&mdash;he says she was “a mad, conceited,
ridiculous woman.”<a name="Anchor_300" id="Anchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 300.">[300]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>
<p>In a book written by a man so intimately
connected with the navy as Pepys was, it is not
surprising that mention should occur pretty frequently
of sailors and soldiers who commanded
at sea.</p>

<p>In the great victory over the Dutch in 1665,
the Earl of Falmouth, Lord Muskerry, and
Richard Boyle, second son of the Earl of Burlington,
were all killed by one shot, as they were
standing on board the “Royal Charles,” close
by the Duke of York, into whose face their
blood spurted. The Earl appears very frequently
in the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>” as Sir Charles Berkeley,
Lord Berkeley, Lord Fitzharding, and Earl of
Falmouth, and he was to have been created a
Marquis had he lived. Charles <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> shed a flood
of tears when he heard of his friend’s death,
but Pepys tells us that none but the King wished
him alive again.<a name="Anchor_301" id="Anchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 301.">[301]</a></p>

<p>Lord Clarendon put in a few bitter words the
most thorough condemnation of the man. He
said, “few had observed in him any virtue or
quality which they did not wish their best friends
without.” The various allusions to Lord Falmouth
in the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>” quite bear out this
character, and yet because he was Sir William
Coventry’s friend we are told of “his generosity,
good nature, desire of public good, and low
thoughts of his own wisdom; his employing his
interest in the king to do good offices to all
people, without any other fault than the freedom
he do learn in France of thinking himself
obliged to serve his king in his pleasures.”<a name="Anchor_302" id="Anchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 302.">[302]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>A much greater national loss which took place
in this engagement was the death of the famous
admiral Sir John Lawson. This chief among
the “tarpaulins” was well known to Pepys, as
he was the vice-admiral under Sir Edward
Montagu at the time when Charles <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> was
brought over by the fleet. He is described as
the same plain man as ever after all his successes,<a name="Anchor_303" id="Anchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 303.">[303]</a>
yet an enemy called him a false man,
and the greatest hypocrite in the world.<a name="Anchor_304" id="Anchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 304.">[304]</a> When
Lawson died, Pepys could not but acknowledge
that the nation had a loss, although he was not
sorry, because the late admiral had never been
a friend to him.<a name="Anchor_305" id="Anchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 305.">[305]</a> In the great engagement
against the Dutch of the 3rd of June, 1665,
Opdam’s ship blew up, and a shot from it, or
rather a piece of iron, wounded Lawson on the
knee, from which he never recovered. The
national loss is expressed in one of the “Poems
on State Affairs.”<a name="Anchor_306" id="Anchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 306.">[306]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In October, 1666, there was a rumour that
Sir Jeremy Smith had killed Sir Robert Holmes
in a duel, and Pepys was not sorry to hear it,
although he soon found that report did not tell
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>true.<a name="Anchor_307" id="Anchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 307.">[307]</a> Holmes was very unpopular, and Andrew
Marvell called him the “cursed beginner of the
two Dutch wars;” describing him as “first an
Irish livery boy, then a highwayman, now
Bashaw of the Isle of Wight,” who had “got in
bonds and by rapine <abbr title="100,000 pounds"><i>£</i>100,000</abbr>.”<a name="Anchor_308" id="Anchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 308.">[308]</a></p>

<p>Sir Jeremy Smith was befriended by the
Duke of Albemarle, when Holmes delivered
articles of accusation against him to the King
and Cabinet, and he suffered no ill from the
vengeance of his enemy, for in 1669 he was appointed
a Commissioner of the Navy in place
of Sir William Penn. Pepys was able to find
an epithet for him, and although he liked him
fairly well, he called him “an impertinent fellow.”<a name="Anchor_309" id="Anchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 309.">[309]</a></p>

<p>This slight notice of some of the sailors of the
Restoration period may well be closed by a relation
of the remarkable action of certain seamen
at the funeral of Sir Christopher Mings. Mings,
like Lawson, was of poor extraction, and, like
him, grew up a worthy captain. He was
wounded in the face and leg in an engagement
with the Dutch, and shortly afterwards died of
his wounds. Pepys and Sir William Coventry
attended the funeral, and on their going away,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>“about a dozen able, lusty, proper men came to
the coach side with tears in their eyes, and one
of them that spoke for the rest begun and said
to Sir W. Coventry, ‘We are here a dozen of
us that have long known and loved and served
our dead commander, Sir Christopher Mings,
and have now done the last office of laying him
in the ground. We would be glad we had any
other to offer after him, and revenge of him.
All we have is our lives; if you will please to
get His Royal Highness to give us a fireship
among us all, here is a dozen of us, out of all
which choose you one to be commander, and
the rest of us, whoever he is, will serve him;
and if possible do that that shall show our
memory of our dead commander and our revenge.’”
When this speech was finished
Coventry was much moved, and Pepys could
scarcely refrain from tears.<a name="Anchor_310" id="Anchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 310.">[310]</a> What became of
these worthy men we are not told.</p>

<p class="drop-cap noindent"><span class="upper-case">No</span> passages in the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>” are more
valuable than those from which
we can gather some idea of the
manners of the time in which
Pepys lived. It is chiefly, in fact,
on account of the pictures of the mode of life
among the men and women of the middle classes
portrayed in those passages that the book has
attained its immense popularity. History instructs,
while gossip charms, so that for hundreds
who desire to learn the chronicle of events,
thousands long to hear how their ordinary fellow
creatures lived, what they ate, what they wore,
and what they did.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>
<p>Pepys liked good living, and he was careful to
set down what he ate, so that we are able to judge
of his taste. This is what he calls a “pretty dinner”&mdash;“a
brace of stewed carps, six roasted
chickens and a jowl of salmon hot, for the first
course; a tanzy and two neats’ tongues, and
cheese the second.”<a name="Anchor_311" id="Anchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 311.">[311]</a> A good calf’s head boiled
with dumplings he thought an excellent dinner,<a name="Anchor_312" id="Anchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 312.">[312]</a>
and he was very proud of a dinner he gave to
some friends, which consisted of “fricasee of
rabbits and chickens, a leg of mutton boiled,
three carps in a dish, a great dish of a side of a
lamb, a dish of roasted pigeons, a dish of four
lobsters, three tarts, a lamprey pie (a most rare
pie), a dish of anchovies, good wine of several
sorts and all things mighty noble and to my
great content.”<a name="Anchor_313" id="Anchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 313.">[313]</a> He was very indignant when
Sir W. Hickes gave him and his fellows “the
meanest dinner (of beef, shoulder and umbles of
venison, which he takes away from the keeper of
the forest, and a few pigeons, and all in the
meanest manner) that ever I did see, to the
basest degree.”<a name="Anchor_314" id="Anchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 314.">[314]</a> Pepys liked all kinds of pies,
whether they contained fish or swan, but there
was one pie in particular that was filled with such
a pleasant variety of good things that he never
tasted the like in all his life.<a name="Anchor_315" id="Anchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 315.">[315]</a> On two several
occasions he records his appreciation of a joint
which sounds strange to modern ears&mdash;<abbr title="videlicet">viz.</abbr>, boiled
haunch of venison.<a name="Anchor_316" id="Anchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 316.">[316]</a> At special seasons he was
in the habit of partaking of the diet appropriate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
to the festival: thus on Shrove Tuesday he ate
fritters,<a name="Anchor_317" id="Anchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 317.">[317]</a> and at Christmas mince pies<a name="Anchor_318" id="Anchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 318.">[318]</a> or plum
porridge,<a name="Anchor_319" id="Anchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 319.">[319]</a> plum pudding not having been at
that time invented. The meat taken with these
sweets was sometimes the orthodox beef, but it
was more often something else, as on Christmas
day, 1660, when it consisted of shoulder of mutton
and chicken.</p>

<p>Breakfast was not formerly made an ordinary
meal, but radishes were frequently taken with
the morning draught. On May 2nd, 1660, Pepys
had his breakfast of radishes in the Purser’s
cabin of the “Naseby,” in accordance with the
rule laid down by Muffet in his “<cite class="plain">Health’s Improvement</cite>”
(1655), that they “procure appetite
and help digestion;” which is still acted upon in
Italy.</p>

<p>Ale-houses, mum-houses, and wine-houses
abounded in all parts of London, and much
money must have been spent in them. The
charges seem to have been high, for Pepys relates
how on one occasion the officers of the
navy met the Commissioners of the Ordnance
at the Dolphin Tavern, when the cost of their
dinner was 34<abbr title="shillings"><i>s.</i></abbr> a man.<a name="Anchor_320" id="Anchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 320.">[320]</a> We are not told how
much Sir W. Batten, Sir W. Penn, and Pepys
had to pay when they ordered their dinner at
the Queen’s Head at Bow, and took their own
meat with them from London.<a name="Anchor_321" id="Anchor_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 321.">[321]</a></p>

<p>There is abundant evidence in the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>”
of the prevalent habits of deep drinking, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>Pepys himself evidently often took more than
was good for him. Men were very generally unfit
for much business after their early dinners; thus
Pepys tells of his great speech at the bar of the
House of Commons that it lasted so long that
many of the members went out to dinner, and
when they came back they were half drunk.<a name="Anchor_322" id="Anchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 322.">[322]</a>
Sir William Penn told an excellent story which
exhibits well the habits of the time. Some
gentlemen (?) drinking at a tavern blindfolded
the drawer, and told him that the one he caught
would pay the reckoning. All, however, managed
to escape, and when the master of the house
came up to see what was the matter, his man
caught hold of him, thinking he was one of the
gentlemen, and cried out that he must pay the
reckoning.<a name="Anchor_323" id="Anchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 323.">[323]</a> Various drinks are mentioned in
the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>,” such as mum (an ale brewed with
wheat), buttered ale (a mixture of beer, sugar,
cinnamon, and butter), and lamb’s wool (a mixture
of ale with sugar, nutmeg, and the pulp of
roasted apples), among other doctored liquors.
Such stuff as this does not indicate a refined
taste, and the same may be said when we find
that wine was also made up for vitiated palates.
On June 10th, 1663, Pepys goes with three
friends to the Half Moon Tavern, and buys some
sugar on the way to mix with the wine. We
read of Muscadel, and various kinds of sack, as
Malago sack, raspberry sack, and sack posset, of
Florence wine, and of Navarre wine. Rhine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>wines must have been popular at this time, if we
may judge from the numerous Rhenish wine-houses
spread about the town. Amongst Pepys’s
papers was found a memorandum on the dangers
England might experience in the event of a war
with France. Lord Dartmouth proposed that
we might ruin the French by forbidding their
wines, “but that he considers, will never be observed
with all our heat against France. We
see that, rather than not drink their wine, we
forget our interest against it, and play all the
villanies and perjuries in the world to bring it
in, because people will drink it, if it be to be had,
at any rate.”<a name="Anchor_324" id="Anchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 324.">[324]</a> What Lord Dartmouth thought
to be impossible was practically effected by the
Methuen treaty in 1703, after the signing of which
French wines were driven out of the English
market for many years by Spanish wines, and it
was long thought patriotic to drink port.</p>

<p>Pepys liked to be in the fashion, and to wear
a newly-introduced costume, although he was
displeased when Lady Wright talked about the
great happiness of “being in the fashion, and in
variety of fashions in scorn of others that are not
so, as citizens’ wives and country gentlewomen.”<a name="Anchor_325" id="Anchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 325.">[325]</a>
The Diary is full of references to new clothes,
and Pepys never seems so happy as when priding
himself upon his appearance and describing the
beauties of velvet cloaks, silk coats, and gold
buttons. In 1663, he found that his expenses
had been somewhat too large, and that the
increase had chiefly arisen from expenditure on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
clothes for himself and wife, although, as already
remarked, it appears that Mrs. Pepys’s share was
only <abbr title="12 pounds"><i>£</i>12</abbr>, against her husband’s <abbr title="55 pounds"><i>£</i>55</abbr>.<a name="Anchor_326" id="Anchor_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 326.">[326]</a> In fact,
our Diarist was at one time rather mean in regard
to the money he allowed his wife, although afterwards
he was more generous, and even gave <abbr title="80 pounds"><i>£</i>80</abbr>
for a necklace of pearls which he presented to her.</p>

<p>One of the strangest attempts to fix a fashion
was made by Charles the Second, who soon, however,
tired of his own scheme. In 1661, John
Evelyn advocated a particular kind of costume
in a little book entitled “<cite class="plain">Tyrannus, or the Mode</cite>.”
Whether the King took his idea from this book,
or whether it originated in his own mind we
cannot tell, but at all events, on the 17th of
October, 1666, he declared to the Privy Council
his “resolution of setting a fashion for clothes
which he will never alter.” Pepys describes
the costume in which Charles appeared on the
15th of October in the following words:&mdash;“A
long cassock close to the body, of black cloth
and pinked with white silk under it, and a coat
over it, and the legs ruffled with black rib and
like a pigeon’s leg, ... a very fine and handsome
garment.” Several of the courtiers offered
heavy bets that Charles would not persist in his
resolution of never altering this costume, and
they were right, for very shortly afterwards it
was abandoned. The object aimed at was to
abolish the French fashion, which had caused
great expense, but in order to thwart his brother
of England’s purpose, the King of France
ordered all his footmen to put on the English
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>vests.<a name="Anchor_327" id="Anchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 327.">[327]</a> This impertinence on the part of Louis
<abbr title="the Fourteenth">XIV.</abbr>, which appears to have given Steele a hint
for his story of Brunetta and Phillis in the “<cite class="plain">Spectator</cite>,”
caused the discontinuance of the so-called
Persian habit at the English Court.</p>

<p>There are occasional allusions in the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>”
to female dress. Thus, on October 15th, 1666,
Lady Carteret tells Pepys that the ladies are
about to adopt a new fashion, and “wear short
coats above their ancles,” in place of the long
trains, which both the gossips thought “mighty
graceful.” At another time Pepys was pleased
to see “the young, pretty ladies dressed like
men, in velvet coats, caps with ribands, and with
laced bands, just like men.”<a name="Anchor_328" id="Anchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 328.">[328]</a> Vizards or black
masks appear to have come into general use, or
rather were revived by the ladies about 1663.
By wearing them women were able to sit out
the most licentious play with unblushing face.
We read that Pepys and his wife went to the
Theatre Royal on June 12th of that year:&mdash;“Here
I saw my Lord Falconbridge and his Lady,
my Lady Mary Cromwell, who looks as well as
I have known her, and well clad; but when the
House began to fill she put on her vizard, and so
kept it on all the play; which of late is become a
great fashion among the ladies, which hides their
whole face.” After the play Pepys and Mrs.
Pepys went off to the Exchange to buy a vizard,
so that the latter might appear in the fashion.</p>

<p>The custom of wearing the hat indoors is
more than once alluded to in the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>,”<a name="Anchor_329" id="Anchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 329.">[329]</a> and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
on one occasion Pepys was evidently much
elated by the circumstance that he was in a
position to wear his hat&mdash;“Here it was mighty
strange to find myself sit here in Committee
with my hat on, while Mr. Sherwin stood bare
as a clerk, with his hat off to his Lord Ashly and
the rest, but I thank God I think myself never
a whit the better man for all that.”<a name="Anchor_330" id="Anchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 330.">[330]</a> This practice,
which still exists in the House of Commons,
was once universal, and in the statutes of the
Royal Society the right of addressing the meeting
with his hat on was reserved to the president,
the other members being expected to
uncover on rising to speak. A few years after
the above committee meeting, it became the
fashion of the young “blades” to wear their
hats cocked at the back of their heads.<a name="Anchor_331" id="Anchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 331.">[331]</a> This
obtained the name of the “Monmouth cock,”
after the popular Duke of Monmouth, and according
to the “<cite class="plain">Spectator</cite>,” it still lingered in the
west of England among the country squires as
late as 1711. “During our progress through the
most western parts of the kingdom, we fancied
ourselves in King Charles the Second’s reign,
the people having made little variations in their
dress since that time. The smartest of the
country squires appear still in the Monmouth
cock.”<a name="Anchor_332" id="Anchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 332.">[332]</a></p>

<p>Gloves were then, as now, looked upon as an
appropriate present to a lady, and Pepys often
bought them for this purpose. On October 27th,
1666, he gave away several pairs of <i>jessimy</i> or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>jessemin gloves, as Autolycus says, “gloves as
sweet as damask roses;” and on January 25th,
1668–69, he was vexed when his wife wanted
him to buy two or three dozen perfumed gloves
for her. Those who did not wear these useful
coverings laid themselves open to remark, as we
read of Wallington, a little fellow who sang an
excellent bass, that he was “a poor fellow, a
working goldsmith, that goes without gloves to
his hands.”<a name="Anchor_333" id="Anchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 333.">[333]</a> The use of muffs by men became
common after the Restoration, and continued till
Horace Walpole’s day, and even later. November,
1662, was a very cold month, and Pepys
was glad to wear his wife’s last year’s muff, and
to buy her a new one. The long hair worn by the
cavaliers was superseded soon after the Restoration
by the use of wigs. Pepys went on the 29th
of August, 1663, to his barber’s to be trimmed,
when he returned a periwig which had been
sent for his approval, as he had not quite made
up his mind to wear one, and “put it off for a
while.” Very soon afterwards, however, he
ordered one to be made for him;<a name="Anchor_334" id="Anchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 334.">[334]</a> and then he
had his hair cut off, which went against his inclination.
The new wig cost three pounds, and
the old hair was used to make another.<a name="Anchor_335" id="Anchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 335.">[335]</a> This
last only cost twenty-one shillings and sixpence
to make up, and the peruque-maker promised
that the two would last for two years.<a name="Anchor_336" id="Anchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 336.">[336]</a> The Duke
of York very soon followed the fashion set by
his subordinate, and put on a wig for the first
time on February 15th, 1663–4. These magnificent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
ornaments, which look so grand in the portraits,
were very apt to get out of order, and on
one occasion Pepys had to send his wig back to
the barber’s to be cleansed of its nits. No wonder
he was vexed at having had it sent to him in
such a state.<a name="Anchor_337" id="Anchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 337.">[337]</a> On May 30th, 1668, he came to an
agreement with his barber to keep his wigs in
good order for twenty shillings a year. It is remarkable
that people did not return to the sensible
fashion of wearing their own hair after the
plague, when there must have been great dread
of infection from this source. Pepys bought a
wig at Westminster during the sickness, and was
long afraid to wear it. He adds, “it is a wonder
what will be the fashion after the plague is done,
as to periwigs, for nobody will dare to buy any
hair, for fear of the infection, that it had been
cut off the heads of people dead of the plague.”<a name="Anchor_338" id="Anchor_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 338.">[338]</a></p>

<p>Before passing on to consider some other customs,
a word should be said on the practice of
wearing mourning. When the Duke of Gloucester
died, it is related that the King wore
purple, which was used as royal mourning. At
the same time Mrs. Pepys spent <abbr title="15 pounds"><i>£</i>15</abbr> on mourning
clothes for herself and husband.<a name="Anchor_339" id="Anchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 339.">[339]</a> We are
told how the whole family went into black on
the death of the elder Mrs. Pepys,<a name="Anchor_340" id="Anchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 340.">[340]</a> and we have
very full and curious particulars of the funeral of
Thomas Pepys. For this occasion Samuel had
the soles of his shoes blacked, which seems a
rather odd kind of mourning!<a name="Anchor_341" id="Anchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 341.">[341]</a></p>

<p>The engagement between Philip Carteret and
Lady Jemimah Montagu gave the Diarist considerable
employment, and from the long account
he has written on it we gather that he was very
proud of such assistance as he was able to give.
Carteret was a shy young man, and needed
much instruction, as to how he should take the
lady’s hand, and what he should do. The whole
description is very droll, but too long to quote
here. Pepys made the best of the affair, but he
evidently thought his <i>protégé</i> a very insipid lover.
The wedding took place on July 31st, 1665, the
bride and bridegroom being in their old clothes,
but Pepys was resplendent in a “new coloured
suit and coat trimmed with gold buttons, and
gold broad lace round his hands, very rich and
fine.” This is the account of what occurred after
supper:&mdash;“All of us to prayers as usual, and the
young bride and bridegroom too; and so after
prayers soberly to bed; only I got into the bridegroom’s
chamber while he undressed himself,
and there was very merry till he was called to
the bride’s chamber, and into bed they went. I
kissed the bride in bed, and so the curtains
drawn with the greatest gravity that could be,
and so good night. But the modesty and gravity
of this business was so decent that it was to me,
indeed, ten times more delightful than if it had
been twenty times more merry and jovial.”</p>

<p>There are several allusions in the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>” to
the custom of scrambling for ribbons and garters
at weddings, and Pepys expresses himself as not
pleased when favours were sent to others after
Lord Hinchingbroke’s wedding, and he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
overlooked.<a name="Anchor_342" id="Anchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 342.">[342]</a> At this time wedding rings were
not the plain and inelegant things they are now,
but were frequently ornamented with precious
stones, and almost invariably had a motto engraved
upon them. Pepys’s aunt Wight was
“mighty proud” of her wedding ring, which cost
her twelve pounds, and had been lately set with
diamonds.<a name="Anchor_343" id="Anchor_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 343.">[343]</a></p>

<p>It is not necessary to remark that there was a
considerable laxity of manners during the period
with which we are now dealing, as this is pretty
well known, but one or two passages in the
“<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>” may, perhaps, be alluded to here. On
one occasion Mrs. Turner, the wife of a serjeant-at-law,
while dressing herself in her room by the
fire, took occasion to show Pepys her leg, which
she was very proud of, and which he affirms
was the finest he had ever seen.<a name="Anchor_344" id="Anchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 344.">[344]</a> At another
time, Pepys went to Lady Batten’s, when he
found her and several friends very merry in her
chamber; Lady Penn flung him down upon the
bed, and then herself and the others came down
one after another upon him. He might well add,
“and very merry we were.”<a name="Anchor_345" id="Anchor_345" href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 345.">[345]</a></p>

<p>This laxity of manners is invariably laid to
the demoralizing effect of the Restoration, but it
is evident from this portion of the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>,”
which was written before that event, that it was
as usual for men to visit ladies in their bedrooms
before Charles <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> “returned to take possession
of his birthright,” as it was afterwards. Thus
we read that on February 24th, 1659–60, Pepys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
took horse at Scotland Yard, and rode to Mr.
Pierce, “who rose, and in a quarter of an hour,
leaving his wife in bed (with whom Mr. Lucy,
methought, was very free as she lay in bed);
we both mounted and so set forth about seven
of the clock.” This remark probably offended
Lord Braybrooke’s modesty, for it appears for
the first time in Mr. Mynors Bright’s edition.</p>

<p>There are several passages in the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>”
which are of interest, as showing how our ancestors
travelled. Although travelling by coach
was a very slow operation, much ground could be
got over in a short space of time on horseback.
On the 6th of July, 1661, Pepys set out for
Brampton about noon, and arrived there at nine
o’clock at night; having ridden at the rate of
about nine miles an hour, with allowance for
stoppages for refreshment.</p>

<p>The first great improvement in coach-building
was made soon after the Restoration, when glass-coaches
were introduced. The Comte de
Grammont did not approve of the coach made for
the King, and therefore ordered from Paris an
elegant and magnificent calash, which was greatly
admired, and cost him two thousand louis.</p>

<p>There were some who did not appreciate the
improved carriages, and were alive to the evils
that were caused by the change. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>“Another
pretty thing was my Lady Ashly’s speaking of the
bad qualities of glass-coaches, among others the
flying open of the doors upon any great shake;
but another was that my Lady Peterborough
being in her glass-coach with the glass up, and
seeing a lady pass by in a coach whom she
would salute, the glass was so clear that she
thought it had been open, and so ran her head
through the glass!”<a name="Anchor_346" id="Anchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 346.">[346]</a></p>

<p>It is a curious instance of the survival of terms
in popular language that certain carriages were
styled glass-coaches even within living memory.</p>

<p>Although the hours kept by “society” in
Charles <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr>’s reign were considerably earlier than
those now adopted, and Pepys often went to bed
by daylight,<a name="Anchor_347" id="Anchor_347" href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 347.">[347]</a> yet people did sit up very late
sometimes. On the 9th of May, 1668, the House
of Commons sat till five o’clock in the morning
to discuss a difference that had arisen between
them and the House of Lords. One night Pepys
stayed at the office so late that it was nearly two
o’clock before he got to bed,<a name="Anchor_348" id="Anchor_348" href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 348.">[348]</a> and at another time
the servant got up at the same hour to do the
week’s washing.<a name="Anchor_349" id="Anchor_349" href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 349.">[349]</a> The watchman perambulated
the streets with his bell and called out the hours,
so that when Pepys was sitting up to fill up the
entries in the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>,” he often heard the cry
“Past one of the clock, and a cold, frosty, windy
morning,”<a name="Anchor_350" id="Anchor_350" href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 350.">[350]</a> or some similar information.</p>

<p>It is not easy to settle with any great accuracy
the respective values of money at that time
and at present, as many things were considerably
cheaper, but others were dearer. Bab May
said that <abbr title="300 pounds"><i>£</i>300</abbr> per annum was an ample income
for a country gentlemen; a remark that was repeated
by Marvell, and increased by him to
<abbr title="500 pounds"><i>£</i>500</abbr>. The gentry did not like this criticism,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>but it shows at least that money had a much
greater purchasing power then than now. In
the winter of 1666–67 the farmers were very unfortunate,
and many were forced to become
bankrupts, so that property previously bringing
in <abbr title="1,000 pounds"><i>£</i>1,000</abbr><a name="Anchor_351" id="Anchor_351" href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 351.">[351]</a> suddenly became worth only <abbr title="500 pounds"><i>£</i>500</abbr>.
The wages of a cookmaid were <abbr title="4 pounds"><i>£</i>4</abbr> a year, which
Pepys thought high,<a name="Anchor_352" id="Anchor_352" href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 352.">[352]</a> and a coach cost <abbr title="53 pounds"><i>£</i>53</abbr>,<a name="Anchor_353" id="Anchor_353" href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 353.">[353]</a> but
a beaver hat was charged as high as <abbr title="4 pounds"><i>£</i>4</abbr> 5<i><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></i><a name="Anchor_354" id="Anchor_354" href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 354.">[354]</a>
Twenty-five pounds was paid for a painted
portrait, and <abbr title="30 pounds"><i>£</i>30</abbr> for a miniature, and <abbr title="80 pounds"><i>£</i>80</abbr> for a
necklace of pearls. Cherries were sold at two
shillings a pound,<a name="Anchor_355" id="Anchor_355" href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 355.">[355]</a> oranges at six shillings a
dozen, and dinners at an ordinary varied from
seven shillings to a guinea.</p>

<p>There are so many little items in the “<cite>Diary</cite>”
which are of interest as illustrating old customs,
some of which still exist, and others which have
died out, that it would be quite impossible to
allude here even to a fraction of them. One or two
instances, therefore, gathered at random, must be
sufficient. Pepys on several occasions mentions
the custom of “beating the bounds” in the various
parishes on Ascension Day or Holy Thursday,
when a boy was in some cases beaten, or, as in
Dorsetshire, tossed into a stream, in order to impress
very forcibly upon his memory the locality
of the parish boundaries. At one time he writes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>“This day was kept a holy-day through the
town; and it pleased me to see the little boys
walk up and down in procession with their broomstaffs
in their hands, as I had myself long ago
gone,”<a name="Anchor_356" id="Anchor_356" href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 356.">[356]</a> and at another, “They talked with Mr.
Mills about the meaning of this day, and the
good uses of it; and how heretofore, and yet in
several places, they do whip a boy at each place
they stop at in their procession.”<a name="Anchor_357" id="Anchor_357" href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 357.">[357]</a> Allusion has
already been made to the mixed motives that
drew Pepys to church, and how he often attended
more to the pretty faces in the congregation
than to the words of the preacher. He had
high authority for his conduct in the demeanour
of the court, and he himself tells us how, while
Bishop Morley (of Winchester) was preaching
on the song of the angels, and reprehending the
mistaken jollity of the court, the courtiers “all
laugh in the chapel when he reflected on their
ill actions and courses.”<a name="Anchor_358" id="Anchor_358" href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 358.">[358]</a></p>

<p>There is comparatively little in the “<cite>Diary</cite>”
about the Nonconformists, although in the early
part of his career Pepys was more favourable to
their claims than to those of the conforming
clergy. He was once induced to give five shillings
to a parson among the fanatics, who said a
long grace like a prayer, and was in great want,
although he would willingly have done otherwise.
His aunt James, “a poor, religious, well-meaning,
good soul,” told him that the minister’s prayers
had helped to cure him when he was cut for the
stone.<a name="Anchor_359" id="Anchor_359" href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 359.">[359]</a></p>

<p>We have a curious peep into a rustic church<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
which Pepys and his cousin Roger attended
on the 4th of August, 1662: “At our coming
in, the country people all rose with so much
reverence; and when the parson begins, he begins
‘Right worshipful and dearly beloved,’ to us.”</p>

<p>There are several allusions in the “<cite>Diary</cite>” to
various punishments in vogue at the time. In
1663, the parish of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Olave’s was supplied with
a new pair of stocks “very handsome,” and one
Sunday, a poor boy who had been found in a
drunken state by the constable, was led off “to
handsel them.”<a name="Anchor_360" id="Anchor_360" href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 360.">[360]</a> It was formerly the custom to
punish offenders on the spot where their crimes
had been committed; thus, on February 18th,
1659–60, two soldiers were hanged in the Strand
for their mutiny at Somerset House. The bodies
of the criminals were frequently allowed to hang
in some conspicuous spot until they rotted away;
and on April 11th, 1661, Pepys and “Mrs. Anne”
“rode under the man that hangs upon Shooter’s
Hill, and a filthy sight it is to see how his flesh
is shrunk to his bones.” London must have
exhibited a ghastly appearance when the heads
of traitors were stuck up on the city gates, on
Temple Bar, Westminster Hall, and other public
places. The heads and the limbs were covered
with pitch, and remained in their elevated
position for years, until in many cases they were
blown down by the wind. Pepys once found
the head of a traitor at the top of one of the
turrets of Westminster Abbey.<a name="Anchor_361" id="Anchor_361" href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 361.">[361]</a> Some of Charles
<abbr title="the First">I.</abbr>’s judges received an easier punishment. William
Monson, the “degraded” Earl of Castlemaine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
Sir Henry Mildmay, and Robert Wallop
were sentenced to imprisonment for life, and to
be drawn on sledges with ropes round their necks
from the Tower to Tyburn and back, on the
anniversary of the late King’s execution. Pepys
met the three sledges on Tower Hill on the
27th of January, 1661–62.</p>

<p>If called upon in the character of a judge to
sum up the case against the people of England
in respect to their manners after the Restoration,
I think it would be but fair to say that these were
better than those of their rulers. It was not until
after the Revolution, when the vices of Charles’s
court had had time to pollute the children of the
men who brought him back, that the lowest
depths of immorality were reached.</p>

<p class="drop-cap noindent full"><span class="upper-case">In</span> dealing with the amusements of
Pepys’s day, we find how pre-eminent
a position the theatre held
in popular esteem. The presentation
of a new play was looked
upon as an event of the greatest moment, and
the various appearances of favourite actors were
chronicled in the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>” with considerable
regularity.</p>

<p>Immediately after the Restoration, two companies
of actors were organized, who acted at
two different houses: one theatre was known as
the King’s house, and the other as the Duke’s
house. Sir William Davenant obtained a patent
for his company under the name of “The Duke’s
servants,” and as he had succeeded during the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
Commonwealth in performing certain dramatic
pieces under cover of a musical accompaniment,
his theatre was sometimes known as “The
Opera.” A patent for “The King’s servants”
was granted to Tom Killigrew, whose house
was for distinction’s sake called “The Theatre.”
Pepys has registered as many as 145 plays
which he saw acted, some of them several times
over, and there is every reason to believe that
he saw many more during the period over which
the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>” extends, that he has omitted to
mention.<a name="Anchor_362" id="Anchor_362" href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 362.">[362]</a> When the theatres were first opened,
the old plays were revived until the living
dramatists had time to produce new ones, but
several of the old masterpieces held their ground
for many years. Among the revived dramatists
were Marlowe, Shakespeare, Ben Jonson, Beaumont
and Fletcher, Ford, Massinger, and Shirley.
In the whole of Evelyn’s “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>,” <cite class="plain">Hamlet</cite>
is the only play of Shakespeare which the author
mentions as having seen acted, and his observation
upon this is that “now the old plays begin to
disgust this refined age, since his Majesty’s been
so long abroad.”<a name="Anchor_363" id="Anchor_363" href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 363.">[363]</a> Yet, in the one month of
December, 1660, Pepys had seen two distinct
plays of Shakespeare, and after the date of
Evelyn’s entry, he saw Henry <abbr title="the Fourth">IV.</abbr>, <cite class="plain">Hamlet</cite>,
<cite class="plain">Twelfth Night</cite>, <cite class="plain">Merry Wives</cite>, <cite class="plain">Romeo and
Juliet</cite>, <cite class="plain">Midsummer Night’s Dream</cite>, <cite class="plain">Henry <abbr title="the Eighth">VIII.</abbr></cite>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
<cite class="plain">Macbeth</cite>,<cite class="plain"> Othello</cite>, <cite class="plain">Taming of a Shrew</cite>, and
<cite class="plain">Tempest</cite>, which proves that Shakespeare was
more generally appreciated than is usually supposed.
Here we have eleven plays, which is
the largest number of plays by one dramatist,
with the exception of Fletcher, whose separate
productions and joint ones with Beaumont number
as many as twenty-four. Shirley comes
next with nine, then Ben Jonson with five, Ford
with two, and Massinger with the same number.
We have already seen how little Pepys appreciated
Shakespeare’s genius, but it seems as
if he could not enough express his delight in
the plays of Ben Jonson. He describes the
“<cite class="plain">Alchymist</cite>” as “a most incomparable play,”<a name="Anchor_364" id="Anchor_364" href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 364.">[364]</a>
and the “<cite class="plain">Silent Woman</cite>” as “the best comedy,
I think, that ever was wrote;”<a name="Anchor_365" id="Anchor_365" href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 365.">[365]</a> of “<cite class="plain">Every Man
in His Humour</cite>,” he writes, “wherein is the
greatest propriety of speech that ever I read in
my life.”</p>

<p>Although some of the actors had gained experience
on the stage of Charles <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr>’s reign, most
of them were novices, and it is therefore remarkable
to find such an array of talent at both
houses.</p>

<p>Most of the old players were attached to the
King’s company. Hart, Mohun, and Burt were
all fine actors, and they had acted female parts
before the suppression of the theatre, but Betterton,
one of the greatest actors that ever lived,
was a host in himself and the mainstay of the
Duke’s house. Pepys was never tired of lauding
his powers, and delighted in seeing him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>act. His Hamlet was “beyond imagination,”<a name="Anchor_366" id="Anchor_366" href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 366.">[366]</a>
and his Henry <abbr title="the Fifth">V.</abbr> “incomparable.”<a name="Anchor_367" id="Anchor_367" href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 367.">[367]</a> Mrs.
Knipp was one of those actresses of whom little
or nothing is known outside the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>,” but
who makes a considerable figure there. Pepys
was very partial to this free-and-easy lady, and
when we read of his behaviour to her we need
not be surprised to find Mr. Knipp alluded to
as a “jealous-looking fellow.”<a name="Anchor_368" id="Anchor_368" href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 368.">[368]</a> This is the place
to expose a cruel slander against a worthy man,
which Pepys has embalmed in his pages and
which has not been corrected by the editors.
Pepys having occasion to mention Anne and
Beck Marshall, the well-known actresses, he sets
down that Mrs. Pierce told him how they were
the daughters of Stephen Marshall, the great
Presbyterian, and then reports Nell Gwyn’s
often-quoted speech to Beck as to the difference
in the education of the two; the latter being “a
Presbyter’s praying daughter.”<a name="Anchor_369" id="Anchor_369" href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 369.">[369]</a> With such an
authority it is not surprising that Lord Braybrooke
should reproduce the statement in a note
to another passage,<a name="Anchor_370" id="Anchor_370" href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 370.">[370]</a> but on investigation the
whole bubble bursts. Stephen Marshall died
on the 19th of November, 1655, and was buried
in Westminster Abbey. At the date of his will
his wife was dead, and five of his daughters
were already married, three of them at least to
clergymen. The remaining daughter, Susan,
who was unmarried, must have been more than
twenty-one years of age at the time of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
father’s death, as she proved his will. These
important facts were discovered by Colonel
Chester, and set forth in his remarkable volume,
“Westminster Abbey Registers.” It did not
concern the Colonel to discover the parents of
Anne and Rebecca, but he proved very conclusively
that they were not the children of the
<abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Stephen Marshall. Another blunder is
made in the “<cite class="plain">Memoirs of Count Grammont</cite>,”
where “Roxolana” in Davenant’s “<cite class="plain">Siege of
Rhodes</cite>,” is confused with “Roxana” in Lee’s
“<cite class="plain">Rival Queens</cite>,” and in the notes it is inferred
that one of these Mrs. Marshalls was seduced
by Aubrey de Vere, last Earl of Oxford, of that
name. The “Roxolana” who was deceived by
Lord Oxford with a false marriage, was Elizabeth
(or Frances) Davenport, who is frequently
mentioned by Pepys.</p>

<p>At the revival of the stage after the Restoration,
a more lavish expenditure on scenery and
dresses became common. Pepys tells us that
when Ben Jonson’s “Catiline” was acted at the
King’s House, Charles <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> gave the actors <abbr title="500 pounds"><i>£</i>500</abbr>
for robes which were required.<a name="Anchor_371" id="Anchor_371" href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 371.">[371]</a> We also learn
that “the gallants do begin to be tired with the
vanity and pride of the theatre actors, who are
indeed grown very proud and rich.”<a name="Anchor_372" id="Anchor_372" href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 372.">[372]</a> But a few
years afterwards, when Pepys stepped up to
Harris’s dressing-room after the play, he observed
“much company come to him and the
wits, to talk and to assign meetings.”<a name="Anchor_373" id="Anchor_373" href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 373.">[373]</a> When
Kynaston was beaten by Sir Charles Sedley for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
imitating him, the manager of the King’s theatre
was forced to read Kynaston’s part in “<cite class="plain">The
Heiress</cite>,” much to the disadvantage of the <i>vraisemblance</i>
of the play. Pepys writes, “but it was
pleasant to see Beeston come in with others
supposing it to be dark, and yet he is forced to
read his part by the light of candles, and this I
observing to a gentleman that sat by me, he was
mightily pleased therewith, and spread it up and
down.”<a name="Anchor_374" id="Anchor_374" href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 374.">[374]</a> Pepys had occasional talks with Tom
Killigrew on the state of the stage, and heard
from him of the scheme for setting up a nursery
of young actors in Moorfields, where plays
should be acted; “but four operas it shall have
in the year, to act six weeks at a time; where
we shall have the best scenes and machines, the
best music and everything as magnificent as in
Christendom.” For this purpose Killigrew
“sent for voices and painters and other persons
from Italy,”<a name="Anchor_375" id="Anchor_375" href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 375.">[375]</a> but all this fine project came
to naught, and two years afterwards he explained
to Pepys all that he had done for the
theatre and what he proposed still to do. He
said <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>“that the stage is now by his pains a thousand
times better and more glorious than ever
heretofore. Now wax-candles and many of
them; then not above 3 lbs. of tallow: now all
things civil, no rudeness anywhere; then, as in
a bear-garden: then, two or three fiddlers; now,
nine or ten of the best: then, nothing but rushes
upon the ground, and everything else mean;
now, all otherwise: then, the Queen seldom, and
the King never would come; now, not the King
only for state, but all civil people do think they
may come as well as any.”<a name="Anchor_376" id="Anchor_376" href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 376.">[376]</a></p>

<p>The theatres were open in the afternoon, three
o’clock being the usual hour for performance,
and the plays were therefore acted by daylight
during the summer. The roof consisted of skylights
made of thin glass, which let the wet into
the pit in times of heavy rain. Pepys felt the
inconvenience on one occasion, and he wrote:
“Before the play was done it fell such a storm
of hail, that we in the middle of the pit were
fain to rise, and all the house in a disorder.”<a name="Anchor_377" id="Anchor_377" href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 377.">[377]</a>
A few years after this the very same inconvenience
was experienced. “A disorder in the pit
by its raining in from the cupola at top,” and
this must often have happened.<a name="Anchor_378" id="Anchor_378" href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 378.">[378]</a></p>

<p>When plays were acted at court, the performances
took place at night, probably because
the actors were then free after acting at the
theatres. Sometimes even the King had to
wait, as we read, “after all staying above an
hour for the players, the King and all waiting,
which was absurd, saw ‘<cite class="plain">Henry <abbr title="the Fifth">V.</abbr></cite>’ well done
by the Duke’s people, and in most excellent
habits, all new vests, being put on but this
night.... The play continued till twelve at
night.”<a name="Anchor_379" id="Anchor_379" href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 379.">[379]</a></p>

<p>It is here necessary to guard readers of the
“<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>” against a mistake very easily fallen into
in respect to the various theatres, as the editors
have given no explanation to guide them.
Davenant’s, or the Duke’s, company occupied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
the old “Cockpit” in Drury Lane for a short
time after the Restoration, until they removed
to Lincoln’s Inn Fields, in the spring of 1662.
Now Pepys frequently mentions the plays acted
at the Cockpit, but these were performed at
night, and apparently the Cockpit alluded to
was the one at Whitehall, not that in Drury
Lane. This seems evident by an entry under
date <abbr title="November">Nov.</abbr> 20, 1660: “I found my Lord in bed
late, he having been with the King, Queen and
Princess at the Cockpit all night, where General
Monk treated them; and after supper a play;”
because the Duke of Albemarle lived at the
Cockpit in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> James’s Park. Peter Cunningham
mentions in the “Handbook of London,”
that he found in the records of the Audit Office
a payment of <abbr title="30 pounds">xxx<span class="super">li</span>.</abbr> per annum, “to the Keeper of
our playhouse called the Cockpitt, in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> James’s
Park,” but he gives no further particulars and
does not appear to have noticed how far the
entries in the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>” illustrate this appointment.
On December 1st, 1662, the Duke’s company
acted before the King at the Cockpit, and
January 5th, 1662–63, the King’s company acted
in the same place, but Pepys did not think the
latter at all equal to “the Duke’s people.”</p>

<p>All the entries in the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>” relating to the
stage require more investigation than they have
yet received, as the notes of the editors are quite
insufficient. We have seen how the allusions to
the “Cockpit” in the years 1660–62, might
either refer to the Duke’s theatre or to the
Court theatre, and the same confusion might
easily be made in respect to the Lincoln’s Inn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
theatre. Pepys says that on November 20th,
1660, he and Mr. Shepley went “to the new
play-house near Lincoln’s Inn Fields (which was
formerly Gibbon’s tennis-court).” This was the
home of the King’s company from 1660 till
1663, when they went to Drury Lane. As already
stated, the Duke’s company removed to
Portugal Street in 1662, so that for a short
period the two rival theatres were close together
in the neighbourhood of Lincoln’s Inn Fields.
Pepys visited all parts of the house, and did not
much care where he sat so that he got in: thus
on November 7, 1667, he was “forced to sit
in the side balcony over against the music-room,
close by my Lady Dorset and a great many
great ones;” and some years before he was
somewhat troubled to be seen by two or three
of his clerks, who were in the half-crown box,
while he was in an eighteenpenny place.<a name="Anchor_380" id="Anchor_380" href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 380.">[380]</a> The
price of a pit seat was <abbr title="2 shillings and sixpence">2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></abbr>, and in spite of
the inconvenience of the place in wet weather, it
was frequented by people of fashion; for instance,
the Duke of Buckingham sat there, and was surrounded
by Lord Buckhurst, Sir Charles Sedley,
Sir George Etherege, and other poets;<a name="Anchor_381" id="Anchor_381" href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 381.">[381]</a> and “a
company of fine ladies” was not absent.<a name="Anchor_382" id="Anchor_382" href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 382.">[382]</a> But
even at that time “citizens, ’prentices and others”
jostled their betters. Pepys writes: <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>“I do not
remember that I saw so many, by half, of the
ordinary ’prentices and mean people in the pit
at <abbr title="2 shillings and sixpence">2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></abbr> apiece as now; I going for several
years no higher than the 12<i><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></i> and then the 18<i><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></i>
places, though I strained hard to go in when I
did.”<a name="Anchor_383" id="Anchor_383" href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 383.">[383]</a> The theatres were generally crowded,
and on special occasions it was difficult to find a
place. When Etherege’s “She Would if She
Could” was first acted, 1,000 persons were turned
away because there was no room in the pit an
hour before the performance commenced.<a name="Anchor_384" id="Anchor_384" href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 384.">[384]</a> An
ingenious plan for keeping seats which was in
vogue for many subsequent years is mentioned
by Pepys. On May 2, 1668, he writes: “To
the Duke of York’s play house at a little past
twelve, to get a good place in the pit for the
new play, and there setting a poor man to keep
my place, I out and spent an hour at Martin’s,
my bookseller’s, and so back again, where I find
the house quite full. But I had my place.”</p>

<p>When the theatre built for the King’s company
in Drury Lane, was opened in 1663,
Pepys found some faults in the construction, one
of these being the narrowness of the passages
in and out of the pit. He did not approve also
of the placing of the orchestra under the stage,
by which means the basses could not be heard at
all, and the trebles very faintly.<a name="Anchor_385" id="Anchor_385" href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 385.">[385]</a></p>

<p>Pepys does not mention Fop’s Corner in the
King’s theatre, a name which recalls the better-known
Fop’s Alley of Her Majesty’s Opera
House, but it is alluded to in Dryden’s epilogue
spoken at the new house in Drury Lane on
March 26th, 1674:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="p_line_i0">“So may Fop Corner full of noise remain,</div>
    <div class="p_line_i0">And drive far off the dull attentive train.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>
<p>Pepys does, however, tell us how loudly
people of fashion talked. One day Sir Charles
Sedley had a merry discourse with two ladies,
which prevented the Diarist from hearing any
of the play. His feelings were divided between
pleasure in hearing the wit and annoyance
in losing the play.<a name="Anchor_386" id="Anchor_386" href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 386.">[386]</a> The manners of most of
the audience, as exhibited in several little traits,
were far from commendable, but it would be difficult
to equal the following incident, which is related
as if there were nothing particularly unladylike
in it: “I sitting behind in a dark place
[in the theatre], a lady spit backward upon me by
mistake, not seeing me, but after seeing her to be a
very pretty lady, I was not troubled at it at all.”<a name="Anchor_387" id="Anchor_387" href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 387.">[387]</a></p>

<p>One of the institutions of the theatre was
Orange Moll, who is frequently mentioned in the
“<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>.” The orange girls stood with their backs
to the stage, and the beaux in the pit broke jests
with them. One of these women tried to impose
upon Pepys by affirming that she had delivered a
dozen oranges to some ladies in a box in accordance
to his order, “which was wholly untrue, but
yet she swore it to be true.” He denied the
charge, and would not pay, but for quiet bought
four shillings’ worth of oranges at 6<i><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></i> apiece.<a name="Anchor_388" id="Anchor_388" href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 388.">[388]</a>
This was the usual price, as we learn from the
prologue to Mrs. Behn’s “Young King,” 1698:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="p_line_i0">“Half crown my play, sixpence my orange cost.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The mistress or superior of these women was
named, for distinction, Orange Moll.</p>

<p>Pepys makes a passing allusion to the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
practice of placing the notices of performances
on posts, but the editors have left the passage
without explanation. He writes: “I went to
see if any play was acted, and I found none upon
the post, it being Passion week.”<a name="Anchor_389" id="Anchor_389" href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 389.">[389]</a> This is well
illustrated by an anecdote:&mdash;“Master Field, the
player, riding up Fleet Street a great pace, a
gentleman called him, and asked what play
was played that day? He (being angry to be
stayed upon so frivolous a demand) answered
that he might see what play was to be played upon
every <em>post</em>. I cry you mercy (said the gentleman)
I took you for a <em>post</em> you rode so fast.”</p>

<p>The other amusements mentioned by Pepys
sink into insignificance by the side of the
theatre, but a short enumeration of some
of them may be given here. The cock-pit,
in Shoe Lane, was a well-known place of
resort for sporting men, and Pepys went to
see some cock-fighting there, but he soon had
enough of it, although he was glad to have seen
“the strange variety of people.”<a name="Anchor_390" id="Anchor_390" href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 390.">[390]</a> He went on
one occasion to the Bear Garden, on the Bankside,
“and saw some good sport of the bull’s
tossing of the dogs: one into the very boxes,”
but he did not much like the company, and on
the whole he thought it “a very rude and nasty
pleasure.”<a name="Anchor_391" id="Anchor_391" href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 391.">[391]</a> At another time he went to the
same place to see a prize fight, but being ashamed
to be seen, he went in a back way (getting
among the bulls, and fearing to be too near the
bears) and sat with his cloak before his face.<a name="Anchor_392" id="Anchor_392" href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 392.">[392]</a></p>

<p>Pepys did not practise athletic sports himself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
but he liked to see them practised by others. He
was a spectator at a very serious fencing-match
where the combatants cut each other rather
severely both in the head and legs.<a name="Anchor_393" id="Anchor_393" href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 393.">[393]</a> The King
was a good player at tennis, but Pepys thought
it “a loathsome sight” to see his play “extolled
without any cause at all.”<a name="Anchor_394" id="Anchor_394" href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 394.">[394]</a> Charles was in the
habit of weighing himself before and after a
game, and on a certain occasion he lost four and
a-half pounds. The best players in England
were said to be Prince Rupert, Bab May, Captain
Cooke, and Mr. (afterwards Sir Thomas)
Chicheley.<a name="Anchor_395" id="Anchor_395" href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 395.">[395]</a> Pepys liked a game of bowls, because
he could play it with the ladies;<a name="Anchor_396" id="Anchor_396" href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 396.">[396]</a> and
he sometimes condescended to have a game at
ninepins.<a name="Anchor_397" id="Anchor_397" href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 397.">[397]</a> Gaming ran high at Court, and we
are told that Lady Castlemaine played <abbr title="1,000 pounds"><i>£</i>1,000</abbr>
and <abbr title="1,500 pounds"><i>£</i>1,500</abbr> at a cast, winning <abbr title="15,000 pounds"><i>£</i>15,000</abbr> one
night, and losing <abbr title="25,000 pounds"><i>£</i>25,000</abbr> on another night.<a name="Anchor_398" id="Anchor_398" href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 398.">[398]</a>
No wonder Bishop Morley denounced this
excess in play, and specially commented on the
groom-porter’s conduct in one of his sermons
before the Court.<a name="Anchor_399" id="Anchor_399" href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 399.">[399]</a></p>

<p>There are several references in the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>”
to games of cards, but in most instances the particular
game played is not mentioned. Cribbage,
handycap (a game like loo), and gleek (played
by three persons with forty-four cards), are, however,
all specially alluded to.<a name="Anchor_400" id="Anchor_400" href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 400.">[400]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>
<p>Pepys played at shuttlecock on January 11th,
1659–60; at shuffle (or shovel) board on July
30th, 1662, and on April 1st, 1665, and at tables
or backgammon on September 11th and 16th,
1665. Among the minor amusements must be
mentioned the crying of forfeits,<a name="Anchor_401" id="Anchor_401" href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 401.">[401]</a> blindman’s buff,<a name="Anchor_402" id="Anchor_402" href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 402.">[402]</a>
and crambo or tagging of rhymes.<a name="Anchor_403" id="Anchor_403" href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 403.">[403]</a></p>

<p>Dancing was in high repute, and Pepys describes
the various balls pretty fully. On the 31st
of December, 1662, there is some lively dancing
at Whitehall. The King (a good dancer) opens
the ball with the Duchess of York, and the
dancing commences with the Bransle or “brawl,”
of Shakespeare and Gray. Then follows the swift
coranto, and the country dances. When the
King stood up, all the ladies, even the Queen
herself, rose. A few years later a gallant company
again meet at the palace, and the same
order of proceeding is followed. First comes
the brawl, then the coranto, and last of all a
dance from France, which the King calls the
“new dance.”<a name="Anchor_404" id="Anchor_404" href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 404.">[404]</a></p>

<p>Pepys learns the coranto himself in May,
1663, and two years afterwards he disputes with
Captain Taylor on the best way of dancing it.<a name="Anchor_405" id="Anchor_405" href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 405.">[405]</a>
At first Pepys’s Puritan leanings led him to look
rather unfavourably upon dancing, but in the
end he became tolerably fond of it. On January
6th, 1667–68, he had a party for which he
engaged four fiddlers at a cost of <abbr title="3, pounds"><i>£</i>3,</abbr> and everything
went off very satisfactorily in consequence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
All that Pepys has to say about amusements is
to be found in the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>,” for his letters contain
no information respecting the stage or the
balls at Court. This is only another indication
of how much we have lost by the discontinuance
of the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>,” for it is scarcely possible to
believe that the man who exhibited so absorbing
an interest in the proceedings of the theatre,
should suddenly have ceased to visit it.</p>

<p class="drop-cap noindent"><span class="upper-case">Now</span> that all the divisions of our
subject have been discussed, there
is little to add in a concluding
chapter. We have seen Pepys in
his poverty, when he and his wife
struggled to keep up a decent appearance with
an empty larder and a fireless grate at home.
We have seen the sudden change, when he became
rich and increased his expenses with an
ever-present sense of the effect of his movements
upon the outer world. And, lastly, we have seen
how he lived to an honoured old age, and passed
out of life as a worthy example of virtue and
honour. We have peeped into some of his
dearly-loved books, and seen how the “Bibliotheca
Pepysiana” helps to illustrate the character
of its founder.</p>

<p>Having thus looked at the man as he lived,
we passed on to his surroundings. First, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
dealt with the town he loved and knew so well,
then made the acquaintance of the relations and
friends that surrounded him, and lastly, tried to
understand the arrangements of the office where
he spent so large a portion of his life. This was
the inner circle. The frequenters of the Court
and the public characters with whom he came
into occasional contact or knew only from observation
at a distance, formed the outer circle of
his life.</p>

<p>Byron, in allusion to the question, “Where
is the world?” asked by Dr. Young at the age
of eighty, cried out:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="p_line_i40">“Alas!</div>
    <div class="p_line_i0">Where is the world of <em>eight</em> years past? ’Twas there&mdash;</div>
    <div class="p_line_i2">I look for it&mdash;’tis gone, a globe of glass</div>
    <div class="p_line_i0">Crack’d, shiver’d, vanish’d, scarcely gazed on, ere</div>
    <div class="p_line_i2">A silent change dissolves the glittering mass.</div>
    <div class="p_line_i0">Statesmen, Chiefs, Orators, Queens, Patriots, Kings,</div>
    <div class="p_line_i0">And Dandies, all are gone on the wind’s wings.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Yet we may point to the pages of Pepys’s
“<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>,” and say that there the globe is still
whole, and that there men and women of nearly
three times eighty years ago live and move before
our eyes.</p>

<p>In taking leave of the official, the gossip, the
musician, and the man of letters, I can only express
the hope that these pages may be found a
useful companion to one of the most interesting
books in the English language.</p>

it was purchased by the trustees of the National Portrait

<h4>BUST.</h4>

<p>The following extracts from the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>” refer to a
bust which was made for Pepys:&mdash;</p>

<p class="quote_app"><abbr title="February">Feb.</abbr> 10, 1668–69: “So to the plaisterer’s at
Charing Cross that casts heads and bodies in
plaister: and there I had my whole face done;
but I was vexed first to be forced to daub all my
face over with pomatum: but it was pretty to feel
how soft and easily it is done on the face, and by
and by, by degrees how hard it becomes, that you
cannot break it, and sits so close, that you cannot
pull it off, and yet so easy, that it is as soft as a
pillow so safe is everything where many parts of
the body do bear alike. Thus was the mould
made; but when it came off there was little pleasure
in it, as it looks in the mould, nor any resemblance
whatever there will be in the figure
when I come to see it cast off.”</p>

<p class="quote_app"><abbr title="February">Feb.</abbr> 15, 1668–69: “To the plaisterer’s, and
there saw the figure of my face taken from the
mould: and it is most admirably like, and I will
have another made, before I take it away.”</p>

of old musical instruments will help to
illustrate some of Pepys’s allusions:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The lute about three hundred years
ago was almost as popular as is at the
present day the pianoforte. Originally it had eight
thin catgut strings arranged in four pairs, each being
tuned in unison; so that its open strings produced
four tones; but in the course of time, more strings
were added. Until the sixteenth century twelve was
the largest number, or rather, six pairs. Eleven appear
for some centuries to have been the most usual number
of strings: these produced six tones, since they were
arranged in five pairs and a single string. The latter,
called the <i>chanterelle</i>, was the highest. According to
Thomas Mace, the English lute in common use during
the seventeenth century had twenty-four strings,
arranged in twelve pairs, of which six pairs ran over
the finger-board and the other six by the side of it.
This lute was therefore, more properly speaking, a
theorbo. The neck of the lute, and also of the theorbo,
had frets consisting of catgut strings tightly fastened
round it at the proper distances required for ensuring a
chromatic succession of intervals.... The lute was
made of various sizes according to the purpose for
which it was intended in performance. The treble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
lute was of the smallest dimensions, and the bass lute
of the largest. The theorbo, or double-necked lute,
which appears to have come into use during the sixteenth
century, had, in addition to the strings situated
over the finger-board, a number of others running at
the left side of the finger-board, which could not be
shortened by the fingers, and which produced the bass
tones. The largest kinds of theorbo were the <i>archlute</i>
and the <i>chitarrone</i>.</p>

<p>“The most popular instruments played with a bow
at that time [1659] were the treble-viol, the tenor-viol
and the bass-viol. It was usual for viol players to
have ‘a chest of viols,’ a case containing four or more
viols of different sizes. Thus Thomas Mace, in his
directions for the use of the viol, ‘<cite class="plain">Musick’s Monument</cite>,’
1676, remarks: ‘Your best provision and most complete,
will be a good chest of viols six in number, <abbr title="videlicet">viz.</abbr>,
two basses, two tenors, and two trebles, all truly and
proportionably suited.’ The violist, to be properly
furnished with his requirements, had therefore to supply
himself with a larger stock of instruments than the
violinist of the present day.</p>

<p>“That there was, in the time of Shakespeare, a musical
instrument called <i>recorder</i> is undoubtedly known
to most readers from the stage-direction in ‘<cite class="plain">Hamlet</cite>’:
‘Re-enter players with recorders.’ But not many are
likely to have ever seen a recorder, as it has now
become very scarce.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Engel’s</span> <cite>Musical Instruments</cite>

Officers of the Navy; <abbr title="videlicet">viz.</abbr>, Treasurers, Comptrollers, Surveyors,

<p class="drop-cap noindent"><span class="upper-case">From</span> the middle of the 16th to the end of the
17th century, Chatham was by far the most
important of the English naval stations, and
the Commissioner resident there had from the
first a seat and vote at the Board in London&mdash;a
privilege which was not extended to his colleague at Portsmouth
until a much later date. The rise of the latter port
dates from the alliance with the Dutch, and war with France
which followed the accession of William and Mary, and which
made it necessary to establish a first-class naval yard at a less
distance from the French coast than Chatham. The same
cause led to the construction of a dry dock at Plymouth.
See “Edmund Dummer,” in the list of Surveyors of the
Navy.</p>

<p>The figures in the first column represent the year of
appointment, when that can be ascertained. The prefix
“<abbr title="circa">circ.</abbr>” implies that the person named in the second column
is known to have held the office at the time stated, although
the date of first appointment is not known. In some cases
the only date that can be found is that of an order to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
Attorney-General to prepare letters patent; sometimes that
of the patent itself; sometimes of a warrant to execute the
office, notwithstanding that the patent is not yet passed;
and occasionally that of a letter from some person at Court
informing his correspondent that the King or Queen has
signed such and such a patent. It has been thought better,
therefore, to state only the <em>year</em> of appointment, as the insertion
in lists of this kind of the month and day tends to give
them a delusive appearance of accuracy.</p>

<p>The scantiness of <abbr title="manuscript">MS.</abbr> records before the Revolution arises
from the practice which existed of retiring Officers taking
away with them their office books and papers, which they
regarded as their own property. This was put a stop to in
the Dockyards by a Navy Board Order of the 18th August,
1692. Unless otherwise stated, the manuscripts in the following
lists are in the British Museum.</p>

written in a very neat hand of the period, and
signed by Borough himself in a different, but also
very neat, hand. As William Holstock was certainly
Comptroller at this time, and had been so
for more than twenty years, it is probable that he
and Borough held that office jointly, whilst Borough
also performed the functions of Clerk of
the Ships. (<a href="#Ref_Comptrollers" title="Go to reference"><i>See</i> List of Comptrollers.</a>) As Winter
died in 1581, and Borough had certainly been
Clerk for some time before the date of his letter,

  <i>Note respecting Sir Phineas Pett.</i>&mdash;There were so many shipbuilders
of the name of Phineas Pett, that it is often difficult to trace the history
of any one of them. In February, 1660, Phineas Pett, son of John
Pett, and grandson of Commissioner Phineas Pett, being then Assistant-Master
Shipwright at Chatham, petitioned to be promoted, and was
appointed Master Shipwright at Chatham in the same month. But it
would appear that the appointment was revoked, or never carried into
effect, for in the following July we find Phineas Pett, “of Ratcliffe,”
who had been appointed Master Shipwright at Portsmouth in June,
transferred to Chatham in the same capacity. And in September
Phineas Pett, Assistant-Master Shipwright at Chatham, was suspended
from office on the accusation of having, <em>when a child</em>, spoken contemptuously
of the King! For this offence he was dismissed in the
following month.

   The charge was not so frivolous after all, for the writer of an article
on the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>” in the “<cite class="plain">Edinburgh Review</cite>” for July, 1880, points out
that although Pepys denied publicly that he ever possessed a crucifix,
he positively states in the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>” that he had one. See July 20,
August 2, and November 3, 1666. I ought to have noted this, as the
facts are given in the Index to the “<cite class="plain">Diary</cite>.”

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

<p>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE<br />
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
